Recent progress in the analysis of lipid bilayer atomistic resolution structure and dynamics
using combination of robust experimental data and molecular dynamics simulations is reviewed.
The focus is on order parameters and spin relaxation times measured with NMR and on form factors
measured with SAXS and SANS for phosphatidylcholine lipid bilayers. The experimental observables
are chosen since these experiments are robust, well understood, highly reproducible and the connection
between raw data and simulations is straightforward. Also the comparison between simulations
and these observables is bidirectionally useful; it will quantitatively measure the quality 
of the simulation model respect to the reality, and if the quality is sufficient, the simulations
give structural interpretation for the experimental data. Significant advance of molecular dynamics
simulation models is that the same simulation model can be simultaneously compared to all of
this parameters. If satisfactory agreement is found, it is highly likely that the model
represents the reality due to the large amount of reproduced independent experimental parameters. 
In this case all the mentioned experiments would be simultaneously interpreted with the same model.
Phosphatidylcholine lipids are chosen since large portion of model membrane studies have been 
focused on this lipid, producing enough experimental and simulation data to draw comprehensive
picture on the level of understanding atomistic resolution structure and dynamics.
We conclude that the acyl chain region structure and its changes are generally well described in simulations, 
in contrast to the glycerol backbone and choline. Also cation binding is significantly overestimated
by several models.

\section{Introduction}
\todo{Citations missing}
Atomistic resolution structure and dynamics of lipid bilayers has been studied
with wide range of techniques for many decades motivated mainly
by their presence and important role in biological systems \cite{??}.
Lipid bilayers play direct or indirect role in several physiological and pathological
molecular scale processes \cite{??}. To fully understand these processes the atomistic and
molecular level understanding of lipids is required. Since atomistic resolution studies are
extremely difficult from biological samples, purified lipid systems are often used \cite{??}.
The biological relevance of these model systems is supported, e.g. by similar NMR order parameters 
mesured from living cells, lipid extracts and model systems \cite{??}. 

The most detailed information about lipid bilayer atomistic resolution structure and dynamics has been
achieved with various Nuclear Magnetic Resonance (NMR) and scattering techiques \cite{??}. 
The first one giving direct information on structures sampled by individual lipid molecules \cite{??} and
the latter one giving complementary information on average bilayer properties, like density and thickness \cite{??}.
Both techniques give robust, accurate and reproducible quantities related to the strucuture and dynamics.
However, for structural and dynamical interpretation both techniques needs a model which reproduceing 
the measured quantities \cite{??}. 

On the other hand, remarkable progress in hardware and software has made possible to 
routinely perform classical atomistic resolution molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of lipid bilayer with 
duration of tens or hundreds nanoseconds. Ideally the molecules are sampling realistic
conformations with realistic speed in these simulations. This can be verified by calculating
directly measurable quantities from simulations and comparing these to experimental values.
Here we review such comparisons for different experimental observables: C--H bond order parameters,
spin relaxation times and form factor. The first and second are measured with NMR thus they 
represent to structure and dynamics sampled by individual lipid molecules, respectively.
The last is measured with scattering techniques and represents the bilayer average properties.

The order parameters and spin lattice relaxation times have been compared between simulations
and experiments for validation and interpretation since the early days of lipid MD simulations \cite{??}.
On the other hand, scattering form factors for lipid bilayers have been replacing the 
comparisons of simulations to the experimental area per molecule during the last decade
since form factor is directly measurable quantity while area per molecule value depends on
model used to analyze the scattering data \cite{nagle00}.

If an atomistic resolution model reproduces all the above mentioned experimental parameters,
i.e. order parameters, spin relaxation rates and form factor, the simulation can be considered
as an ultimate model giving interpretation for all these experiments simulatenously.
In addition, it would be the correct atomistic resolution representation of the system with high
probability since it reproduces large amount of indendetly measured experimental parameters 
simulatneously. Thus, the model usage of the for further applications would be well justified.

Here we review recent studies which have compared the order parameters, spin relaxation rates
and scattering form factors between experiments and simulations in order to quantify the quality
of simulation models and interpret the experiments.  We focus on phosphatidylcholine lipid
bilayers due to most comprehensive available datasets for both, simulations and experiments.
However, the basic ideas of the approach is valid also for other lipids and surfactants and there
is also data and literature available \cite{??}. We also discuss the observed structural changes of
lipids induced by external conditions and their relation, e.g. to ion partition. 
 
The general conclusion from the review is that the hydrophopic acyl chain region is well described
in simulation models and the atomistic resolution interpretation of experiments has been successfull 
for this region. However, the interfacial region is less well described in simulation models which
may question their usability in studies where this region is important.

In addition to the structural lipid studies, the atomistic resolution lipid bilayer simulations are nowdays
widely used to study for example membrane interactions with other biological molecules 
(e.g. proteins, drugs, ions etc.) \cite{??}. Since the lipid structures and 
interactions with other molecules may be highly relevant in some of these applications,
it is crucial to be aware the weak points of the models. One goal of this review
is to ease the credibility evaluation of different simulation results in these applications.

\subsection{Definition and properties of C-H bond order parameter}\label{OPdefinition}
In lipid bilayer systems the order parameter of a hydrocarbon C--H vector is typically defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{orderP}
S_{{\rm CH}}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3 \cos^2 \theta-1 \rangle,
\end{equation} 
where the angle brackets denote an ensemble average over the sampled conformations, and $\theta$ is the 
angle between the C--H bond and the membrane normal.
The numerical values of order parameters vary between $-\frac{1}{2} < S_{{\rm CH}} < +1$
depending on the sampled $\theta$ distribution.
The definition is motivated by its connection to the dipolar and quadrupolar splitting measured with
$^1$H-$^{13}$C and $^2$H NMR techniques, respectively. The functional form comes from 
the fundamental theory of interactions between spin systems which gives a connection between 
average molecules orientations and NMR measurables~\cite{abragam}. 

If the sampled distribution of $\theta$ for a C--H bond are known, the order parameter
can be straighfowardly calculated from Eq. \ref{orderP}. However, the sampled $\theta$ 
distribtions cannot be uniquely determined from the known order parameter. Thus the experimental
order parameter values gives a set of conditions which structural molecular model 
(more specifically the C--H bond vectors of the model) has to fulfill
but the experimental order parameters alone cannot be used to uniquely 
resolve the structure. The same applies practically to all
experimental parameters used in biomolecular structure determination. 

Atomistic resolution molecular dynamic simulations naturally produces the
sampled structures from which the $\theta$ distributions can be calculated and
used in Eq.~\ref{orderP} to calculate the order parameters.
The sampled structures in the simulation can considered to be realistic
only if the experimental order parameters are reproduced.
If this is the case, the simulation can be then considered 
as an atomistic resolution interpretation of experimental order parameters.
Before MD simulations were feasible for such usage, other models have been used for this interpretation~\cite{seelig74,gally75,seelig77,seelig78,strenk85,baenziger91,hong95b,bruzik97}.
It is important to note, however, that the sampled structures which reproduce the order parameters are not 
necessarily the correct ones since, in principle, several structural models can produce the same order parameters. 
Significant advance of the MD models compared to the traditional models is that the same MD 
structures can be straightforwardly compared to other experimental observables in addition to order parameters, 
like $^{31}$P chemical shift anisotropy~\cite{chowdhary13}, $^{31}$P-$^{13}$C dipolar couplings~\cite{prakash10}
and scattering data~\cite{??}. This will significantly reduce the 
possibility of getting unrealistic structures reproducing correct order parameters.

The probability for unrealistic structures with correct order order parameters is further reduced by
the detailed and accurate experimental data available for order parameters.
Order parameters are known with high quantitative accuracy for each C-H bond present in the lipid molecule
for several lipid types~\cite{leftin11,marsh13,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13,leftin13,leftin14,botan15}. 
The absolute values of order parameters can be measured two independent
techniques by using either $^2$H NMR~\cite{seelig77c,jacobs81,davis83} or $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13} and
the sign can be measured with two different $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR techniques~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}.
It is also possible that two hydrogen bonds in the same carbon has different order parameters ({\it forking})
which can be detected with both $^2$H NMR~\cite{seelig75,gally81,engel81} and $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR~\cite{gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13} techniques.
As a result, for example for POPC lipid molecule in lipid bilayer there is 82 order parameter numbers
known experimentally and a structural model for this lipid should reproduce all of these.
If some the order parameters are not reproduced, it is easy to detect the weak parts of the model
since a single order parameter is very local quantity depending only on the position of two atoms (C-H pair).
This is an advance over several other accurately measured NMR quantities, 
like $^{31}$P chemical shift anisotropy~\cite{chowdhary13} and $^{31}$P-$^{13}$C dipolar couplings~\cite{prakash10}
which depend on the position of several atoms, thus in the case of disagreement, it is more difficult 
to pinpoint the problems in the model.

%if discprepancy is found in order parameter related to certain bond it is known that the model has problems
%in the orientation of this specific bond. This gives order parameters a significant advance over, e.g. other
%accurate NMR obervables like ??. These can be also used to quantify the structural quality, however, in the
%case of disagreement the problem points in the model are more difficult to localize.


%In sections~\ref{??} and~\ref{??} we review the most relevant experimental and molecular dynamics simulation aspects related to the usage of
%order parameters in order to interpret the atomistic resolution structure of lipid bilayers. In section~\ref{??} we
%discuss the connection between structure and order parameters.


The order parameters are typically measured from multilamellar samples which are good for comparison to MD 
simulations since it a nearest experimental correspondence for a simulation box with periodic boundary conditions. 
In this work we do not discuss order parameters measured for other type of samples, 
e.g. bicelles~\cite{aussenac03,raffard00,sanders92}, or indirect measurements by using, e.g. relaxation
data~\cite{marbella15} since their comparison to simulations is less straightforward.  

The available experimental data for order parameters is reviewed
quite recently~\cite{leftin11,marsh13}. These reviews are comprehensive especially for 
acyl chains in pure lipid bilayer samples. In addition to this, there is significant
amount of order parameter data for glycerol backbone and headgroup segments~\cite{botan15}, and
also data as a function of changing conditions for all lipid segments~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,scherer89,kuchinka89,roux90,ulrich94,douliez95,dvinskikh05a,mallikarjunaiah11,ferreira13,leftin13,leftin14}.
The amount of data, especially from $^{13}$C NMR, has been also increasing lately~\cite{ferreira13,leftin13,leftin14}.
Especially the order parameter data of headgroup responses to varying conditions 
has a lot of unused pontential since it can used to measure, e.g. ion partitioning to lipid
bilayer \cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89,ionpaper} and lipid protein interactions \cite{roux89,kuchinka89,leftin13}. Simultaneously, it
gives accurate experimental parameters which can be directly compared to MD simulations \cite{botan15,ionpaper}.




 

\subsection{Order parameters from $^2$H NMR experiments}\label{DopSECTION}

The absolute values of order parameters are connected to the quadrupolar splitting $\Delta \nu_Q$ ($^2$H NMR) 
measured in $^2$H NMR experiments through the equation 
\begin{equation}\label{HNMRop}
|S_{{\rm CD}}|=\frac{4}{3} \frac{h}{e^2qQ} \Delta \nu_{{\rm Q}}, 
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the elementary charge, $Q$ is the deuteron quadrupole moment and $h$ is the Planck's constant. 
The parameter $q$ is related to the largest electric field gradient and in practise its value is not known; 
therefore the static quadrupolar coupling constant $\frac{e^2qQ}{h}$ is defined, and its value measured for 
different compounds in their solid state ($\Delta \nu_Q$ measurement from the system where order parameter is known to be 1). 
In C-D order parameter measurements for lipids, it is typical to 
use the value measured for different alkenes, $\frac{e^2qQ}{h}$=170 kHz. The relation between order parameters 
and quadrupolar splittings then becomes $S_{{\rm CD}}=0.00784 \times \Delta \nu_{{\rm Q}}$.
This relation is useful as many publications report only the quadrupolar splittings. For a review and more accurate description see the work of Seelig~\cite{seelig77c}.

For $^2H$ NMR measurements the CH$_2$ segments has to be labeled with deuterium.
This can be done specifically for a certain segment or for the several segments
simultaneously~\cite{davis83,bloom91,leftin11}. In the first case, it is known that the measured
order parameter (quadrupolar splitting) is related to the labeled segment.
In the latter case several order parameters (quadrupolar splittings) are
measured which arise from all the labeled segments, however, it is not known 
which order parameter belongs to which CH$_2$ segment. Majority of the $^2H$ NMR data
in the literature is measured from samples with perdeuterated acyl chain \cite{leftin11,marsh13}
while also order parameter data from specifically deuterated lipids are available for 
several lipid types in various conditions~\cite{seelig74,seelig75,seelig77,seelig78,gally81,akutsu81,altenbach84,scherer89,kuchinka89,roux90,ulrich94,douliez95}.

\subsection{Order parameters from $^{13}$C NMR experiments}\label{CopSECTION}

To determine order parameter with $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR experiments, the dipolar splitting $\Delta \nu_\mathrm{CH}$  is measured. This is then related to
the effective dipolar coupling $d_\mathrm{CH}$ through a scaling factor depending on the pulse sequence used in the 
experiment~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13}. The effective dipolar coupling $d_{{\rm CH}}$ is 
connected to the absolute value of order parameter through equation
\begin{equation}\label{CNMRop}
|S_{{\rm CH}}|=(\frac{D_{{\rm max}}}{2\pi})^{-1}d_\mathrm{CH},
\end{equation}
where $D_{{\rm max}} = \frac{\hbar \mu_0 \gamma_h \gamma_c}{4\pi\langle r_\mathrm{CH}^3 \rangle}$. 
$r_{{\rm CH}}$ is the C-H distance, $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $\gamma_h$ and $\gamma_c$ are 
the gyromagnetic constants for $^1$H and $^{13}$C nuclei. In contrast to Eq.~\ref{HNMRop}, all the parameters in 
Eq.~\ref{CNMRop} are in principle known. However, for the internuclear distance only the average $⟨r_{{\rm CH}}⟩$ 
is known, not the third moment $⟨r^3_{{\rm CH}}⟩$. For this reason values between 20.2-22.7 kHz are used for
$\frac{D_{{\rm max}}}{2\pi}$ depending on the original authors~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,becker05,ferreira13,ferreira15}.

In contrast to $^2$H NMR specific labeling is not needed for $^{13}$C NMR experiments due the 
natural abundance of $ {13}$C, however it could be used to enhance the signal for specific 
segment under interest~\cite{sivanandam09}. Order parameter measurements with $^{13}$C NMR are
2D experiments, the chemical shift being in the first dimension and dipolar coupling 
in the second~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13}. The chemical shift depends on the local chemical environment and 
is different for each carbon segment. In the second dimension the dipolar coupling
(order parameter) corresponding each chemical shift value is measured, and its value 
can be connected, in principle, to each carbon segment by using the chemical shift value.  
This is straighforward for hydrocarbon segments in choline, glycerol backbone, close to the 
double bonds, and in the beginning and the end of acyl chains due to their distinct chemical 
shift values~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13,leftin14}.
Challenges occur in the acyl chain region where chemical shift values 
of different segments are very close to each others~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13,leftin14}. 
This issue has been solved by filtering the spectra by using partially deuterated lipids \cite{ferreira13}
and using data from simulations and specifically deuterated experiments to help in 
the assigment~\cite{ferreira13,leftin14}. 


\subsection{Quantitative accuracy of experimental order parameter values}\label{QUANTaccuracySECTION}

It must be stressed that $^2$H NMR and $^{13}$C NMR are fully independent experiments since the deuterium quadrupolar splitting $\Delta \nu_Q$
and the dipolar splitting $d_{{\rm CH}}$ are different physical observables. In addition, the prefactors connecting the observables to the order 
parameter (Eqs.~\ref{HNMRop} and~\ref{CNMRop}) are independently measured. Further independent experiments are performed With $^{13}$C NMR 
by measuring the $^1$H-$^{13}$C dipolar couplings using different pulse sequences~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13} when the connection
between dipolar splitting $d_{{\rm CH}}$ and effective dipolar coupling $d_\mathrm{CH}$ is different.

The measurements of quadrupole $\Delta \nu_Q$ and dipolar $d_{{\rm CH}}$ splittings are relatively accurate, especially for quadrupolar splitting.
\todo{How accurate exactly?} 
Thus the quantitative accuracy of measured order parameters is mainly determined by the  
prefactors connecting the measured splittings to the order parameters (Eqs.~\ref{HNMRop} and~\ref{CNMRop}). 
Since the prefactors are independently determined for the $^2$H and $^{13}$C NMR measurements,
the quantitative accuracy is best estimated by comparing the independtly measured order parameter values.

The comparisons between order parameters measured with $^2$H NMR and $^{13}$C NMR by several authors
shows very good agreement~\cite{gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13, botan15}.
Botan et al. collected literature values for PC lipid choline headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters 
and concluded that order parameters would be known with the accuracy of $\pm$0.02 for these segments in purified PC lipid bilayer samples~\cite{botan15}
which agrees with the estimate of Gross et al~\cite{gross97}. 
The lower order parameter reported in some studies~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,warschawski05} were suggested to arise from lower experimental accuracy.
The values collected by Botan et al. and the suggested sweet spots where choline and glycerol backbone order parameters should fall in the 
simulation models are shown in Fig.~\ref{allOPs} A).

Acyl chain order parameters from different techniques are compared in Table 1 by Gross et al.~\cite{gross97}, 
Dvinskikh et al.~\cite{dvinskikh05a} and Ferreira et al.~\cite{ferreira13}. The comparison by Ferreira et al.~\cite{ferreira13} 
is also shown in Fig.~\ref{allOPs} C). Generally good agreement between different methods is seen also for
acyl chain order parameters, however, for some segments the 0.02 accuracy might not be achieved.
\todo{Maybe specify to which ones?}.

%In conclusion, comparing the order parameters measured with different techniques based on different physical interactions 
%the accuracy of the prefactors can be estimated. Since the order parameters from different techniques are 
%almost always within $\pm$0.02 this can be considered to be the quantitative accuracy of the measurements.


\subsection{Qualitative accuracy of experimental order parameter values}

When order parameters are measured as function of changing condition (e.g. temperature, hydration level, ion concentration, etc.), 
the prefactors connecting the order parameter and the experimentally measured couplings can be considered 
to be unchanged. Therefore, accuracy of the measured change is determined by the accuracy of the splitting measurement
in contrast to the previous section. Here we refer to this as a qualitative accuracy. Due to the high resolution of
splitting measurements, especially in $ 2$H NMR, the qualitative accuracy is much higher than the
quantitative accuracy discussed in previous section.

The high qualitative accuracy of $^2$H NMR experiments is exemplified in Fig.~\ref{opIONeffect} by using the
the classical experiment by Akutsu and Seelig~\cite{akutsu81}, where the effect of different ions on 
the quadrupolar splittings of choline headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ segments was measured, 
\footnote{These changes were later shown to be consistent with the addition of different charges into the bilayer, and the electrometer 
concept was introduced to measure the amount of charge incorporated in the bilayer interface~\cite{scherer89}.}
see Fig.~\ref{QUADsplitIONeffect}. 
The effects of different ions on the quadrupole splittings are clearly differentiable with the experimental 
accuracy in Fig.~\ref{QUADsplitIONeffect} A). However, when transformed to the order parameter units, 
these changes correspond only changes below 0.03 units for $\beta$ and 0.05 for $\alpha$ as shown in 
Fig.~\ref{QUADsplitIONeffect} B). 
\begin{figure*}[]
%  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=17.2cm]{../Fig/QPandOPwithIONS.eps}
  \caption{\label{opIONeffect}
    A) Quadrupolar splittings as function of different ion concetrations measured by Akutsu and Seelig with $^2$H NMR~\cite{akutsu81}. 
    B) The data from A) translated to order parameters ($S_{{\rm CD}}=0.00784 \times \Delta \nu_{{\rm Q}}$). Also the sign of $\beta$ order parameter is put negative according
    to more recent experiments~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97} (see also Ref.~\cite{botan15} and Section~\ref{signSECTION}).
  } 
\end{figure*}

%The resolution of $^{13}$C NMR experiment depends somewhat on the pulse sequence used. 
As another example of the high qualitative accuracy of order parameter experiments, the measured order parameters
for $\beta$ and $\alpha$ carbons as a function of hydration level for different PC lipids are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{opDEHYDeffect}. Quantitative numbers from different experiments show slight variation between
different temperatures and lipid compositions. However, in all experiments the
order parameters increase with decreasing hydration.
\footnote{This increase is related to the P-N vector tilting more parallel to the membrane plane \cite{botan15}
which is in agreement with electrometer concept suggesting that penetrating charge has opposite 
effect on headgroup tilt leading to decrease of order parameters \cite{scherer89,ionpaper}.}
The smallest order parameter change is only slightly above 0.01 units, measured by Dvinskikh et al. 
with $ 13$C NMR~\cite{dvinskikh05b}, demonstrating that high qualitative accuracy can be
also achieved with $ 13$C NMR.

\end{figure}

In conclusion, the experimental qualitative accuracy order parameter measurements is very high.
It is much higher than the accuracy achieved with state of the art MD simulations.
Thus, the accuracy order parameter change comparison between simulations and experiments is
limited by the simulation accuracy, not experimental. 

On the other hand, it should be noted that since even very small splitting changes can 
be detected experimentally one should always connect these to the changes in real molecules
to avoid overinterpretation. For example, it has been measured that cholesterol induces 
a measurable change (less than 2~kHz) in  quadrupolar splitting~\cite{brown78}. This may tempt to conclude that
cholesterol affects to the choline structure, however, this quadrupolar splitting corresponds
0.016 unit change in the order parameter which indicates almost negligible conformational change~\cite{botan15}.


\subsection{Signs of order parameters}\label{signSECTION}

While only the absolute values of order parameters are accessible with $^2$H NMR, two different 
$^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR techniques allow also the measurement of the sign: 
first Hong et al. first measured order parameter signs for eggPC~\cite{hong95a} and DMPC~\cite{hong95b}; 
then later Gross et al. used a different NMR technique to measure signs for DMPC~\cite{gross97}. 
All the experiments report negative order parameters for almost all the segments, only $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are positive.

Furthermore, the signs~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}  and magnitudes~\cite{gally81,ferreira13,botan15} of choline headgroup 
and glycerol backbone order parameters are practically unaffected by the acyl tail contents of the bilayers. 
Thus, it can be fairly assumed that the order parameter signs for these segments are the same in all PC lipids in bilayer. 
On the other hand, the positive signs for g$_1$, g$_3$ and C$_2$ has been reported by Aussenac et al.~\cite{aussenac03} 
which has led to some confusion in comparison between simulations and experiments~\cite{hogberg08}. 
However, these signs are not directly measured but extracted from the model used to interpret 
$^2$H NMR order parameters from DMPC bicelles. Thus, it is reasonable conclude that 
order parameters are negative for all segments except for $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, as 
directly measured with $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}.

Even though the sign was not measurable with $^2$H NMR, the sign was believed to be negative for acyl chains because $\theta$ was expected to fluctuate 
around 90$^o$ leading to negative order parameters~\cite{seelig77c}. This was later confirmed by using $^{13}$C NMR measurements~\cite{hong95a}. 
Also MD simulations always produce negative order parameters for acyl chains.

%In conclusion, it seems reasonable to assume that the signs measured with $^{13}$C NMR methods~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}
%can be used for all PC lipids in bilayer, i.e. the signs for almost all the carbons are negative, only  $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are positive.

Typically when the response of order parameters to varying conditions (ions, dehydration and cholesterol) is measured, only the absolute 
values are reported~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,bechinger91,ulrich94,dvinskikh05b,ferreira13}. Where clear responses are observed, 
like with multivalent ions~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84} and dehydration~\cite{bechinger91,ulrich94,dvinskikh05b}, the experiments are done by gradually 
changing the conditions and the order parameter response is systematic, see Figs.~\ref{opIONeffect} and~\ref{opDEHYDeffect}. 
Thus, it is reasonable to assume that also the signs are not suddenly changing. However, it seems that the sign of 
the $\alpha$ carbon order parameter does change in response to a large amount of bound charge, such as multivalent ions. In this case, 
the absolute value of the order parameter first decreases to zero and then starts to increase again~\cite{altenbach84,seelig87}, 
as seen from the nicely illustrated spectra shown Fig.~\ref{qsCACLeffect} by Altenbach et al.~\cite{altenbach84}.
\begin{figure}[]

    Quadrupolar splitting $\Delta \nu_Q$ of $\alpha$ of POPC as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration, related to the order parameter as $S_{{\rm CD}}=0.00784 \times \Delta \nu_Q$. 
    We know nowadays that the order parameter of $\alpha$ in the absense of CaCl$_2$ is positive~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}.
    Thus, the most obvious interpertation for the result is that the $\alpha$ order parameter decreases to zero when CaCl$_2$ concentration reaches 2.0M, and 
    above these concentrations becomes increasingly negative with further addition of CaCl$_2$. Reprinted with permission from Altenbach and Seelig, Biochemistry, 23, 3913 (1984). Copyright 1984 American Chemical Society.

\subsection{Forking of order parameters}

It is possible that the CH$_2$ segment is sampling such orientations that the order parameters
for different hydrogens in the same carbon have different values. We call this phenomena as 
{\it forking}, as done also previously to avoid confusion with splittings measured with NMR.
The forking is detected with both $^2$H NMR~\cite{seelig75,seelig78,engel81,gally81} and 
$^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR techniques~\cite{gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13} as two different quadrupolar or dipolar splitting values,
respectively, related to the same CH$_2$ segment.

The forking is observed for g$_1$, g$_3$, and  C$_2$ carbon in the \textit{sn}-2 chain segments in
a fluid PC lipid bilayer, for other CH$_2$ segments the equal order parameters are observed for 
both hydrogens are equal~\cite{seelig74,seelig77,seelig78,gally81,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13}.
The forking has been studied in detail with $^2$H NMR techniques by separately deuterating the 
R or S position in CH$_2$ segment to assign order parameters to correct hydrogens \cite{gally81,engel81}.


$^2$H NMR studies also show that the forking really arises from differently sampled orientations 
of the two C--H bonds, not from two separate populations of lipid conformations~\cite{engel81,gally81}.
This means that realistic atomistic resolution molecular models has to reproduce the forking 
correctly. Thus, the simulated order parameters has to be calculated separately for each hydrogen
by taking into account the isomeric position for the structural comparison to the experimentals.
Recent work by Botan et al. shows that several simulation models has problems in this respect \cite{botan15}
(see also Fig. \ref{allOPs}). 




\subsection{Order parameters from simulations}
In atomistic resolution molecular dynamics simulations molecules are sampling the defined ensemble
according to the used simulation parameters and the coordinates of each atom as a function of time are saved
to the trajectory files. The coordinates in the trajectory file can be straighforwardly used to calculate 
order parameters directly from the definition in Eq.~\ref{orderP}. The average is taken over the molecules and time.

For simulations with united atom models without explicit hydrogen atoms~\cite{ollila07a,vermeer07,botan15}, the hydrogen positions 
can be generated post-simulationally from the positions of the heavy atoms and the known hydrocarbon geometries.
This can be done explicitly by creating a trajectory with added hydrogens~\cite{ollila07a,botan15}, or by using equations
which directly calculate order parameters from heavy atom positions~\cite{tieleman97,vermeer07}.
For C--H and C--H$_2$ segments without forking these two approaches gives essentially identical results
when applied correctly. However, the latter is valid only for the cases with no forking, i.e. order 
parameters are equal for both hydrogens attached to the same carbon. Since this is not known {\it a priori}
for the analyzed model, it is better to use the first approach with explicitly added hydrogens.

The difference in the forking analysis is most likely reason for different choline and glycerol
backbone order parameters reported in the literature for the same model~\cite{poger12,botan15}.
Also different order parameters from the same model for C-H bonds has been reported in literature~\cite{bachar04,ollila07a}
which most likely arises from incorrect implementation of widely used version of {\it g\_order} program in the Gromacs package
for this segment. Also, the {\it g\_order} program prints -S$_{{\rm CH}}$ which is most likely the reason to
the reported positive order parameters for acyl chains in some studies~\cite{ekkabut07}.
When these issues are taken into account, the order parameters from the same models reported in the
literature are generally in good agreement.

The statistical error estimates for order parameters in simulations are estimated by
using the error of the mean calculated averaging over time blocks~\cite{ollila07a}, over independent 
simulations~\cite{poger12} and over different lipids~\cite{botan15}. The maximum error bars given by
all these approaches are $\sim \pm$0.01.

It was recently pointed out that the sampling of individual dihedral angles might be very
slow compared to the typical (100~ns) simulation timescales~\cite{vogel12}.
This result raises a question if typical simulation time scales are long enough to allow
the molecules to sample the full phase phase. On the other, another recent study showed
that the slowest rotational auto-correlation function observed (for g$_1$ segment) 
in the Berger model reached a plateau ($S_\mathrm{CH}^2$) after $\sim$200~ns
and its relaxation was significantly too slow compared to NMR relaxation experiments~\cite{ferreira15}. 
This indicates that if the typical simulation times are too short for the full sampling
of the structures, then the dynamics is unrealistically slow in the simulation model.


\subsection{Comparison between order parameters from simulations and experiments}

Since the early days of lipid bilayer simulations the acyl chain order parameters are commonly calculated and compared to experiments
when validating simulation studies~\cite{ploeg82,egberts88,stouch93,egberts94,essex94,robinson94,hyvonen95,kothekar96,tieleman96,shinoda97,berger97,tieleman97,klauda08b}. 
Practically all the state of the art force field parametrization publications report these
to be in good agreement with experiments~\cite{berger97,hogberg08,poger10,ulmschneider09,kukol09,chiu09,klauda10,dickson12,jambeck12,chowdhary13,maciejewski14,tjornhammar14,dickson14,lee14}.
It is remarkable that the experimental order parameters for acyl chains in fully hydrated pure lipid bilayers
can be reproduced within experimental error, see also Fig \ref{allOPs} C). 

Exception is the C$_2$ segment in {\it sn-2} chain in all PC lipids which is known
to have measurable forking and lower magnitudes compared to other order parameters in 
the beginning of the acyl chain~\cite{seelig74,seelig75,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13}. This important structural fingerprint is
related to the different conformations between carboxyl segments in the beginning of chains~\cite{schindler75}.
This feature is, however, not analyzed or not reproduced for several lipid models~\cite{hogberg08,siu08,chiu09,kukol09,ulmschneider09,jambeck12,dickson12,chowdhary13,tjornhammar14,maciejewski14}
while some models report the lower magnitude but the forking is not reproduced correctly or analyzed~\cite{siu08,klauda10,chowdhary13,dickson14}.
The united atom CHARMM36 is really close the experimental results~\cite{lee14}.

In addition to the quantitatively good agreement in pure bilayers, the changes in 
acyl chain order parameters as a function of changing conditions are generally reasonable.
For example, experimentally observed increase of order parameters as a function of cholesterol 
concentration~\cite{dufourc84,lafleur90,douliez95,urbina95,vermeer07,ferreira13} and with dehydration~\cite{mallikarjunaiah11,dvinskikh05b} 
are reproduced in simulations \cite{mashl01,hogberg06,vermeer07,zhu07,lim12,ferreira13,jambeck13,madej15}. 
However, systematic and quantitative comparisons of these effects between experiments and simulations are rare~\cite{ferreira13,madej15}.
Comparison between widely used model (Berger lipids \cite{berger97} and H{\"o}ltje cholesterol model \cite{holtje01}
\footnote{In this work CH$_2$/CH$_3$ groups in cholesterol were changed to LP$_2$/LP$_3$ groups to make it more consistent with the Berger
parameters. This is not usually done in the studies done with these model.})
for cholesterol containing lipid bilayer revealed that even though the acyl chain response is reasonable,
the simulation model cannot be considered to agree with experiments with 34\% and higher cholesterol concentrations.
CHARMM36 model has been shown to slightly underestimate the cholesterol ordering effect in DMPC bilayer~\cite{lim12},
while Slipids~\cite{jambeck13} and Lipid14~\cite{madej15} models show satisfactory agreement. Lipid14 is also compared to the same
extensive experimental data for POPC/cholesterol as Berge/H{\"o}ltje model~\cite{ferreira13} and the agreement is 
significantly better~\cite{madej15}, see Fig. \ref{cholTAILmadej}. 
Also the orientation of cholesterol itself is reasonable in all models \cite{vermeer07,lim12,ferreira13,madej15}, however, the cholesterol
acyl chain has some issues in H{\"o}ltje model~\cite{ferreira13} (too low order parameters) and in Lipid14~\cite{madej15} (significant forking) while
CHARMM36 reproduces experiments well~\cite{lim12}. 
%Despite of the problems the Höltje model is used to study the cholesterol acyl chain length effect on bilayer properties \cite{??}.  
\begin{figure*}[]

    The agreement with experiments with this model is significanly better than Beger/H{\"o}ltje based model compared by 
    Ferreira et al. \cite{ferreira13}.
  } 
\end{figure*}


The decrease of acyl chain order parameters due to the addition of double bonds is also 
generally reproduced by different simulation 
models~\cite{hyvonen97,hyvonen97b,feller97,saiz01,huber02,feller02,bachar04,rog04,hyvonen05,ollila07a,dickson12,klauda10,klauda12,ferreira13,jambeck13,lee14,dickson14}. 
Very good agreement for oleyl chain in POPC bilayer with one {\it cis} double bond is demonstrated in Fig.~\ref{allOPs} 
taken from Ferreira et al.~\cite{ferreira13}.
Also the effect of multiple double bonds (polyunsaturation)~\cite{hyvonen97,hyvonen97b,saiz01,huber02,feller02,bachar04,hyvonen05,ollila07a,klauda12} (see Fig. \ref{polyunsat})
and difference between {\it cis} and {\it trans} double bonds can be reproduced in MD simulations \cite{kulig15b}.

   Simulation results are shown in full black, and experimental results
   for comparison in gray. Additionally, part F summarizes the data for
   all bilayers from the simulations. Experimental order parameters were

   are based on studies by Petrache et al. \cite{petrache00} whereas the
   experimental S$_{{\rm CD}}$ values for PDPC and for the sn-1 chain of POPC (T=310 K) 
   are based on studies by Huber et al. \cite{huber02} For the sn-1 chain of
   PDPC, the data set at 310 K is obtained by linearly interpolating
   between data at 303 and 323 K, whereas for the sn-2 chain the data at
   303 K are presented \cite{huber02}. Experimental values for the sn-2 chain of POPC
   are based on studies by Seelig et al. \cite{seelig78} A single experimental value is
   available also for the sn-2 chain of the PLPC bilayer at 313 K
   (diamond) \cite{baenziger91} to compare with our simulated order parameters for PLPC.
   Together with PLPC, there are also experimental results for PiLPC (T=313K) \cite{baenziger91}. 
   Experimental order parameters for the sn-1 and sn-2 chains
   of PAPC (T=303 K) are based on quadrupole splittings measured by
   Rajamoorthi et al. \cite{rajamoorthi91}. For the sn-1 chain the monotonic decrease through
   the acyl chain is expected. For the sn-2 chain, values are fitted such
   that the agreement is as good as possible.

\end{figure}


In contrast to acyl chains, the order parameters for the glycerol backbone are not routinely
reported in simulation literature and when reported, the agreement with experiments is concluded to
be poor \cite{hogberg06,poger12,botan15} or good \cite{hogberg06,hogberg08,kapla12} depending on the authors.
The difference arises from different estimations for the accuracy of experimental and simulated order parameters,
see also section \ref{QUANTaccuracySECTION}.
The NMRLipids collaboration recently carefully compared glycerol backbone and choline order parameters  
from 13 different models to the experiments and concluded that none of the available models
reproduces these within experimental error, see Fig.~\ref{HGorderparameters}.
Also responses of glycerol backbone and choline order parameters to 
dehydration, cholesterol concetration and charge penetration were 
studied by the NMRLipids collaboration \cite{botan15,ionpaper}.
Despite of the incorrect structures in simulation models the experimentally measured choline order
parameter increase due to dehydration \cite{botan15} and decrease due to penetrating 
ions \cite{ionpaper} (see Fig. \ref{changesDUEna}) were qualitatively reproduced. 
The comparison reveals, however, that the Na$ +$ penetration is significantly
overestimated by many models \cite{ionpaper}. 
Also the effect of cholesterol on glycerol backbone and choline was overestimated
by the Berger/Höltje model while CHARMM36 and MacRog performed better \cite{botan15}.

    the ion partition to be measured by changes in $\alpha$ and $\beta$ order parameters.
    The results clearly show that Berger model has too strong Na partition. 
    For more discussion see \cite{ionpaper}.

\end{figure}

In conclusion, the experimental order parameters for acyl chains and their changes are resonably
reproduced all state of the art lipid models (except for C$_2$ segment in {\it sn}-2).
However, all models have difficulties with varying severity to reproduce the glycerol backbone
and choline order parameters, and their changes.



\subsection{Interplay between simulations and NMR order parameters: Validation and interpretation}

As reviewed here, the order parameters can be measured with high accuracy for each hydrocarbon segment in lipid
in bilayer and the values are available in the literature for wide range of different lipids in different conditions.
Thus, the experimental order parameters give very detailed and local information about the orientations
sampled by each C--H bonds in the lipid bilayer system. The order parameters can 
be also calculated from MD simulations with high accuracy and compared to the experiments.
If the order parameters agree within experimental error, the simulated structures can considered as
an structural intepretation for order parameter experiments. On the other hand, if the agreement is not good, 
the simulation is sampling incorrect structures.

As discussed in the previous section, the order parameters for acyl chain region from MD simulations generally 
agree well with experiments (except for the C$_2$ segment in the {\it sn}-2 chain). Thus, the acyl chain structure 
is most likely realistic in simulations and they can used for structural interpretation for this region. 
This is a significant advancement to the traditional structural models build based on the 
fittings to the order paramters~\cite{seelig74,schindler75,seelig78,baenziger91}. The dynamical visualization of simulation trajectory immediately 
reveals very dynamical nature of acyl chains, rapidly sampling large amount of different conformations 
(for dynamics see the Section~\ref{dynamicsSECTION}). These videos published by several authors in supplementary information~\cite{??}
gives significantly better intuitive understanding of dynamical nature of lipid bilayers compared to the static ones from 
traditional models. Since the lipid bilayers can be considered as a simplistic models for cell
membranes and other biological lipid layers, this understanding has significant impact on
biophysics and biochemistry. 

Also the order parameter changes with changing conditions are qualitatively reproduced in the acyl chain region, 
however the systematic quantitative comparison of changes is rare~\cite{ollila07a,ferreira13,madej15}.
The MD simulations have been especially useful to explain the origin of order parameter decrease
due to {\it cis} double bonds in the acyl chain~\cite{feller02,huber02,eldho03,stillwell03,gawrisch03,bachar04,ollila07a}. The order parameter decrease might arise
from reduced order of the chain or from the changed average $\theta$ angle in Eq.~\ref{orderP}.
From NMR experiments alone it was impossible to judge which is the correct explanation for
the decreased order parameters due double bonds~\cite{feller02,huber02,eldho03,stillwell03,gawrisch03}. Several simulation studies by different
authors using different models has showed that the decreased order parameter order parameter due to {\it cis} double
bonds can be reproduced by introducing proper dihedral potentials next to double bonds,
and due to the fexility of these dihedrals the polyunsaturated acyl chain becomes more flexible and
the order is reduced~\cite{feller02,eldho03,stillwell03,gawrisch03,bachar04,ollila07a}. 
These studies concluded that order parameter decrease due to double 
bonds arises from genuine disorder of the chain, not from the changes in average angle~\cite{stillwell03,gawrisch03}.
This is a prime example of the case where MD simulations have significant advance over more traditional 
modeling approaches~\cite{stillwell03}.

The increase of acyl chain order parameters and related bilayer thickening due to addition of cholesterol 
is also qualitatively reproduced by simulations giving also intuitive visualizations for these effects~\cite{ferreira13,madej15}. 
However, quantitative comparison reviewed in previous section revels that some models do not reproduce the 
acyl chain order parameters within experimental error in cholesterol mixtures \cite{lim12,ferreira13}.
This indicates that these models are not yet accurate enough to give atomistic resolution interpretation
to delicate lipid cholesterol interactions which are known to induce liquid-ordereded and liquid-disordered
phase coexistence \cite{ipsen87}. The recent Amber model \cite{madej15} seems promising in this respect, see also Fig. \ref{cholTAILmadej}. 
Careful quantitative comparison of dehydration induced ordering effect has not been made but it is mentioned to be 
weaker in simulations compared to experiments~\cite{hogberg06}. 
%Thus it is not clear if currect simulations
%can be used to, e.g. intepretate atomistic resolution acyl chain ordering due to dehydration which has been
%suggested to play an important role in hydration repulsion \cite{??}.

Simulation studies have also predicted changes in the acyl chain region which are yet to be experimentally 
confirmed, e.g. order parameter decrease due to lipid oxidation and changes in order parameter sign in oxidized 
acyl chain~\cite{ekkabut07}. %A new experimental data can confirm if these predictions can be verified. 


As discussed in the previous section, simulations models are not able to reproduce the glycerol backbone 
and choline headgroup order parameters within experimental error~\cite{botan15} in contrast to acyl chains.
Thus, even the state of the art simulation models are not able to resolve the sampled atomistic resolution
structure of these segments which has been also tremendeous challenge to the more traditional models~\cite{gally75,seelig77,strenk85,akutsu91,bruzik97,Semchyschyn04}.
Consequently, the conclusions made from MD simulations which depend on atomistic resolution structure
of energetics of these segments should be taken with extreme caution.
On the other hand, the qualitative response of choline $\alpha$ and $\beta$ order parameters to the dehydration 
and penetrating ions (increase and decrease, respectively) was correctly reproduced by several models, 
despite of the incorrect structure in fully hydrated lipid bilayer~\cite{botan15,ionpaper}.
These changes could be related with the changes of P--N vector angle respect to the membrane normal as 
suggested previously in~\cite{scherer89}: the tilting of P--N vector more parallel to membrane plane with
dehydration leads to the increase of choline order parameters~\cite{botan15} and {\it vice versa} with penetrating ions~\cite{ionpaper}.
\todo{The analysis with ions not actually done yet!}
The widely used Berger/Höltje model significantly overestimates the structural effects due to cholesterol 
in the glycerol backbone and choline regions~\cite{ferreira13,botan15} which seems to be the 
case also for Lipid14~\cite{madej15}.

The recent progress in the NMRlipids collaboration has shown that simulations confirm the electrometer 
concept suggested by Seelig et al. in a serie of classical publications~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,seelig87,scherer89}: 
the decrease of $\alpha$ and $\beta$ order parameters is a measure of 
charge penetrated in PC lipid bilayer~\cite{ionpaper}, see also Fig,~\ref{changesDUEna}. The concept gives a 
direct and quantitative route to compare charge binding into PC lipid bilayers between simulations
and experiments through the choline order parameters~\cite{ionpaper}. While experimental results show 
only very weak or negligible Na$^{+}$ binding, some simulation models predict significantly stronger
binding, see~\cite{ionpaper} and Fig.~\ref{changesDUEna}. This is a serious artefact since specific cation binding 
makes a lipid bilayer positively charged, which has a potential to lead incorrect conclusion when interactions with
charged objects are studied. Thus the numerous conclusions from simulation studies with strongly binding 
Na$^{+}$ has to be taken with extreme caution. In contrast to monovalent ions the Ca$^{2+}$ and other multivalent ions
significantly partition to PC bilayers~\cite{cevc90,akutsu81,altenbach84}. This is also seen in simulations, however, the structural
effects are overestimated at least in the Berger model~\cite{ionpaper}. The CHARMM36 behaves more realistically, 
however, more careful simulation studies are needed to conclude if some of the existing models in capable to correctly
reproduce PC ion interactions \cite{ionpaper}. 

In conclusion, the atomistic resolution MD simulations are invaluable in understanding the 
structural details and their changes in acyl chain region, especially for double bonds.
However, serious artefacts are possible, or even likely, in simulations studies where choline or
glycerol backbone structure, or cation binding are important.

\todo{This is the first sketch of this section. A lot of references should be added, the text should polished,
things should be added and checked and figures should be improved. However, the main strucutre and idea of the section should be visible.}

\subsection{Definition and properties of rotational autcorrelation function}
The second order auto-correlation function for the reorientation of the C--H chemical bond axis is defined as \cite{Lipari82}
\begin{equation}\label{gt}
g(\tau) = \langle P_2[\vec{\mu}(t)\cdot\vec{\mu}(t+\tau)]\rangle,
\end{equation} 
where $P_2$ denotes the second Legendre polynomial, $P_2(\xi) = 1/2 (3\xi^2 - 1)$, $\vec{\mu}(t)$ is the unitary vector having the 
direction of the C--H bond at time $t$, and the angular brackets denote a time-average. This autocorrelation is usually chosen
to describe the C--H bond rotational dynamics since it is connected to the experimentally measurable spin relaxation rates 
through its Fourier transformation called spectral density
\begin{equation}\label{FT}
j(\omega) =  2\int_0^{\infty} \cos(\omega \tau) g(\tau) d\tau.
\end{equation}
In this review we focus only on experiments measured from multilamellar samples with randomly oriented sheets, 
thus only the second order auto-correlation function is needed~\cite{??}. 

In randomly oriented multilamellar samples the auto--correlation function of bond orientations always decays to zero with
long enough time scales. However, the relaxation timescales can be divided to two distinct timescales.
First the relaxation processes shorter than microsecond timescales occurs when lipid molecules are reorienting
in the lipid bilyer but are not essentially moving between lipid bilayer regions with different orientations.
Then with larger than microsecond timescales the movement between differently oriented bilayer regions
decays the rotational correlation function to zero. In addition, MAS experiments the sample spinning
causes lead orientaitional relaxation in kHz region. The full auto--correlation decaying to zero 
is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{correlationF}. Due to the timescale separation the correlation function can 
be written as~\cite{Nowacka10}
\begin{equation}\label{corrF}
g(\tau)=g_{\rm{f}}(\tau) g_{\rm{s}}(\tau);
\end{equation}
$g_{\rm{f}}(\tau)$ describes the decay of $g(\tau)$ due to fast molecular motions and $g_{\rm{s}}(\tau)$ contains the contribution from slower motions
\begin{equation}\label{MAS}
g_{\rm{s}}(\tau)= e^{- \frac{\tau}{\tau_{\rm{s}}}} \bigg[ \frac{2}{3}\cos(\omega_R \tau) + \frac{1}{3}\cos(2\omega_R \tau)\bigg],
\end{equation}
where $\tau_s$ is a correlation time due to slower isotropic molecular motions originating from the diffusion between bilayers 
with different orientations of their principal symmetry axis, and the cosine terms are the contribution from magic angle spinning 
of the sample, rotating at $\omega_{\rm{R}}/2\pi$ cycles per second~\cite{Hirschinger06}, typically in the kHz frequency range. 

%We expect 
%a two step model behavior \cite{Hal81:1928} of the correlation function $g(\tau)$ as illustrated in Figure \ref{correlation_function} 
%and described as follows. First, $g(\tau)$ will decay due to fast anisotropic molecular motions to a plateau value equal to the square 
%of the order parameter $S_{\rm{CH}}=\langle P_2(\cos\theta)\rangle$, where $\theta$ denotes the angle between the C--H bond and the bilayer 
%normal. $|S_{\rm{CH}}|$ can be accurately measured by a number of NMR techniques~\cite{Lef11:818}. 
%At much longer time scales,  $g(\tau)$ will then oscillate due to MAS and relax to zero because of slower isotropic motions. Since Pake 
%pattern line shapes with splittings $\Delta\nu$ from a few to tens of kHz can be measured for lipid bilayers \cite{Lef11:818,Dav83:117}, 
%the time scale for these isotropic slow motions must be much slower than $1/\Delta\nu$, or deviations from such Pake patterns would be 
%detectable~\cite{Jag87:167}. Thus $g(\tau)$ will only start to decay from the plateau $S_{\rm{CH}}^2$  at time scales well above $\mu$s.


The order parameter measurements with $^2$H NMR and $^{13}$C NMR measure the bond order after the relaxation
of rotational motion inside the bilayer plane but before the relaxation between different bilayer orientations,
as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{correlationF}. In typical molecular dynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions
the lipid molecules are restricted to single bilayer orientation and also the timescales are currently
typically below microsecond. In these simulations the auto--correlation function in Eq.~\ref{gt} decays
to the square of order parameter in Eg.~\ref{orderP} in bilayers with planar symmetry, i.e. no microscopic phase separation of defects present.
Also this is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{correlationF}.

The rotational correlation function describes how long does it take for a single molecule
on average to sample the conformations. The effective correlation time 
\begin{equation}\label{effCTdef}
\tau_{e}:=\int_0^{\infty} \frac{g_{\rm{f}}(\tau)-S_{\rm{CH}}^2}{1-S_{\rm{CH}}^2} \mathrm{d}\tau
\end{equation} 
can be used as an intuitively useful single parameter to describe this time. 
The larger this parameter is, the longer it takes in average to sample the conformations related to the
bond. With this definition the area between the correlation function and its pleateau becomes $(1-S_{\rm{CH}}^2)\tau_{e}$.

\subsection{Detecting C--H bond dynamics experimentally}

The most used parameter to detect the C--H bond dynamics experimentally in time scales comparable to simulations
are the spin-lattice relaxation rates $R_1$ from deuterium labels and $^{13}$C. 
$R_1^{C}$ measured from $^{13}$C is connected to the spectral density (Eq.~\ref{FT}) through the equation
\begin{equation}\label{R1C}
R_{1}^{C}=\frac{D_{\rm{max}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[j(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{C}})+3j(\omega_{\rm{C}})+6j(\omega_{\rm{C}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg],
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\rm{C}}$ and $\omega_{\rm{H}}$ are the Larmor angular frequencies of $^{13}$C and $^1$H respectively, 
$N_{\rm{H}}$ is the number of bound protons and $\frac{D_{\rm{max}}}{2\pi}\approx$22 kHz as in section~\ref{CopSECTION}.
%is given by
%\begin{equation}
%d_{\rm{CH}}=-\frac{\mu_0\hbar\gamma_{\rm{H}}\gamma_{\rm{C}}}{4\pi\langle r_{\rm{CH}}^3\rangle},\nonumber
%\end{equation}
%where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant or vacuum permeability, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, 
%$\gamma_{\rm{C}}$ and $\gamma_{\rm{H}}$ are the gyromagnetic constants of $^{13}$C and $^1$H, respectively, 
%and $\langle r_{\rm{CH}}^3\rangle$ is the average cubic length of the C--H chemical bond. $d_{\rm{CH}}/2\pi$ is 
%approximately equal to -22 kHz for a methylene C--H bond \cite{Bec05:23285,Dvi05:607}.
$R_1^{D}$ measured from $^2$H is connected to the spectral density (Eq.~\ref{FT}) through the equation
\begin{equation}\label{R1D}
R_{1}^{D}=\frac{12\pi^2}{40}\bigg(\frac{e^2qQ}{h}\bigg)^2\bigg[j(\omega_{\rm{D}})+4j(2\omega_{\rm{D}})\bigg],
\end{equation}
where $\frac{e^2qQ}{h}$=170kHz as in the case of order parameters in section~\ref{DopSECTION}.

Also the model free approach to measure the effective correlation time (Eq.~\ref{effCTdef}) was recently
introduced~\cite{ferreira15}. The method is based on the combination of experimental order parameter $S_{{\rm CH}}$,
spin-lattice relaxation rates $R_1$ and the transverse magnetization under a spin lock pulse $R_{1\rho}$ with measured 
appropriate nutation frequency through equation
\begin{equation}\label{ECT}
\tau_{\rm{e}}\approx\frac{5R_{1\rho}^{\rm{plateau}}-3.82R_1^C}{D_{\rm{max}}^2N_{\rm{H}}(1-S_{\rm{CH}}^2)}.
\end{equation} 

%, defines the equilibration of $^{13}$C transverse magnetization under a spin lock pulse and is normally approximated as~\cite{Har86:NMRS}
%\begin{multline}\label{R1rho}
%R_{1\rho}(\omega_1)=\frac{d_{\rm{CH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{40}\bigg[4j(\omega_1)+j(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{C}})
%\\
%+3j(\omega_{\rm{C}})+6j(\omega_{\rm{H}})+6j(\omega_{\rm{C}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg],
%\end{multline}
%where $\omega_1$ is the nutation

\subsection{Analyzing C--H bond dynamics from simulations}

As in the case of order parameters, the auto--correlation function for each C--H bond can be
calculated directly from simulations using the definition in Eq.~\ref{gt} since the trajectories of each atom is known
as a function of time. As in the case of order parameters the positions of hydrogens can be determined 
for united atom models based on heavy atom positions and assuming tetrahedral configurations~\cite{lindahl01,wohlert06,ferreira15}.
Usually in the correlation function calculation all the available time intervals from the 
simulation data are used and the average over those and all molecules is taken. However, since the 
amount of data decreases when the the time interval approaches the total length of the simulation,
usually the largest time interval used is the half of the total simulation length, for more details
see~\cite{gromacsMANUAL}.

To connect the auto--correltaion functions from simulations to the experimentally measurable spin lattice relaxation times, the spectral density (Eq.~\ref{FT})
must be first calculated. In principle, this could be done using numerical fourier transformations techniques, 
however this often leads to unneccessarily large fluctuations. Instead, commonly used apporach is to fit 
analytical functional form to the calculated auto--correlation function and then use analytical Fourier
transform of the fitted function~\cite{pastor88,lindahl01,pastor02,wohlert06,ferreira15}. Most commonly 
the sum of 4 or more exponentials is used as a fitting function~\cite{pastor88,venable93,pastor02,eldho03,ollila07a,ferreira15} but
also streched exponential has been used~\cite{lindahl01,wohlert06}. Numerically the functional form of the fitting function should not matter as
long as the fit is good, however, theoretically the correct correlation function form to describe the modes of
physical motion can be debated~\cite{leftin11,wohlert06,edholm08,klauda08a,klauda08c}. It is clear from correlation functions from simulations that one exponential 
is not enought to produce a good fit while 4 gives a reasonable fit~\cite{eldho03}. This is not surprising since more
than one relaxation timescale is definitiely expected to be present in lipids in bilayer~\cite{pastor88,venable93,pastor02,leftin11}.

After the fitting the analytical form of the spectral density predicted by simulations is available.
Then its values can be calculated at the required larmor frequency values and substituted to Eqs.~\ref{R1C}
and~\ref{R1D} to get the $R_{1}^{C}$ and $R_{1}^{D}$. The value of the effective correlation time can be
calculated directly from the interated area below the correlation function, see Fig.~\ref{correlationF} or from 
Eq. 30 in Ref.~\cite{ferreira15}.




\subsection{Comparing C--H bond dynamcis between simulations and NMR experiments}

The spin lattice relaxation parameters $R_1^{C}$, $R_1^{D}$ and $R_{1\rho}$ are considered as
directly measurable experimental parameters and the effective correlation time $\tau_e$ can be derived directly
from directly measurable parameters without further assumptions (see Eq.~\ref{ECT} and Ref.~\cite{ferreira15}).
Spin lattice relaxation parameters $R_1^{C}$ and $R_1^{D}$ can be calculated from simulations
by first calculating the auto--correlation function (Eq.~\ref{gt}), then calculating the spectral
density from the Fourier transformation (Eq.~\ref{FT}) and finally substituting its values into
Eqs.~\ref{R1C} and~\ref{R1D} (see also previous section). The effective correlation time can be calculated
directly from integrated area and order parameter or from Eq. 30 in Ref.~\cite{ferreira15}.
In practise, the $R_{1\rho}$ cannot be calculated from simulations directly since its value depends
also on the slow relaxation dynamics ($g_s(t)$ in Eq.~\ref{corrF}) which is not present in simulations.
The same applies to the calculation of NOESY relaxations rates and in this case decay time of 170~ns was assumed for the
$g_s(t)$~\cite{feller99}, while 4.2~ms was measured by Ferreira et al.~\cite{ferreira15}.

As seen from Eqs.~\ref{R1C} and~\ref{R1D}, the numerical values of $R_1^{C}$ and $R_1^{D}$ depend also on the carbon $\omega_C$, hydrogen $\omega_H$ and
deuterium $\omega_D$ Larmor frequencies which, in turn, depend on the spectrometer external magnetic field.
From simulations it is straighforwad to calculate the spectral density with any Larmor frequncy value to get
the $R_1^{C}$ and $R_1^{D}$ as a function of external magnetic field.
However, in experiments with standard spectrometers the external field cannot be changed, i.e. each 
spectrometer has their specific field strengths. Thus, to measure $R_1^{C}$ or $R_1^{D}$ values as
a function of magnetic field one has to use several spectrometers which is tedious and spectrometers
excists only with limited amount of magnetic field strengths. Despite of these challenges this kind 
of experiments have been done and the available data is reviewed by Leftin et al.~\cite{leftin11}.
Another approach to measure the magnetic field strength depedence of spin lattice relaxation times
is the Field Cycling NMR~\cite{roberts04a,roberts04b}. However, this is not yet feasible with standard spectrometer
and only limited amount of data is available, mostly from $^{31}$P NMR~\cite{roberts04a,roberts04b,roberts09}
but also from $^{13}$C NMR~\cite{sivanandam09}.

The magnetic field strength dependence of spin relaxation times between simulations and
experiments is compared in several studies~\cite{pastor88,lindahl01,pastor02,klauda08a,klauda08b,wohlert06}. 
Examples of such comparison for acyl chain segments are shown in Fig.~\ref{Rdispersion}.

\end{figure}
On the other, some studies have compared $R_1^{C}$ and $R_1^{D}$ measured with one magnetic field strenght to the value calculated from
simulations~\cite{feller02,eldho03,ollila07a,klauda08b,klauda12,ferreira15}. Example of such comparison between $R_1^{C}$ from simulations and experiments is shown in Fig.~\ref{RandEFFCT}

\end{figure}
Comparisons seems to generally show a good agreement with large larmor frequencies which
is getting worse when the Larmor frequency decreases. On the other hand, the level of the 
agreement depends on the carbon segment and the type of relaxation used in the comparison;
Berger model compared with $2$H NMR gives better agreement for C$_7$ segment compared to
C$_3$ (Fig. \ref{Rdispersion} B)) while comparison to $ 13$C NMR relaxation with one frequency 
gives similar discrepancy for both segments (Fig. \ref{RandEFFCT}). For CHARMM the agreement
seems better when going towards bilayer center, see Fig. \ref{Rdispersion} A).
Due to the complicated connection between molecular dynamics and spin relaxation it
is not straightforward to make conclusions about the dynamical differences between reality
and simulations. This is, however, possible with careful analysis as discussed in the next section.

To ease the intuitive interpretation of experimentally measured rotational dynamics
Ferreira et al. showed that the effective correlation time can be measured by combining 
directly measurable quantities without any assumptions on dynamical prosesses present in the 
fast relaxation regime~\cite{ferreira15}. 
%It should be noted that a quantity called by 
%authors as effective correlation or $\tau_e$ has been reported also previously in the 
%literature, however, these studies typically assume correlation function to have a single
%exponential form \cite{??}. 
%Since molecular dynamical simulations and theoretical understanding
%indicate that assuming a single exponential decay is not realistic, the effective correlation
%times measured with this assumption should not be quantitatively compared to MD simulations
%where multiexponential decay has been observed. The approach by Ferreira et al. is model
%free in the sense that nothing is assumed about the short timescale correlation processes
%when $\tau_e$ is measured \cite{ferreira15}. 
The comparison of effective correlation times
between experiments and simulations for different segments is shown in Fig.~\ref{RandEFFCT}.
From this result it is straightforward to conclude that acyl chain rotational dynamics 
is generally well described while in the interfacial region, especially in glycerol backbone,
the dynamics is too slow in simulations. It should be noted, however, that the effective correlation
describes the total relaxation over all short timescales present in $g_f(t)$. Even if this is 
correct, the balance between different processes with different relaxatio times may not be
correct. This is actually seen in the acyl chains, where $R_1$ does not perfectly agree with
experiments while $\tau_e$ does.  



\subsection{Interplay between simulations and NMR spin lattice relaxation times: Validation and interpretation of dynamics}

By measuring single spin relaxation time values it is almost impossible to make any conclusions
about molecular dynamics due to their complicated connection through the spectral density.
Even changes of relaxation times cannot be directly related to molecular dynamics without further
information since, e.g. faster dynamics may lead to the decrease or increase of spin relaxation times,
depending on the other dynamics processes present and the used magnetic field strength as demonstrated, for example in~\cite{ferreira15}.

Careful studies of spin relaxation times as a function of temperature and magnetic field to overcome this issue are 
recently reviewed by Leftin and Brown~\cite{leftin11}. From compilation of different experimental data sets it was possible 
to conclude, for example, that the interfacial region of lipid molecules has slower dynamics than acyl chains~\cite{leftin11}.
Another successfull approach to interpret the spin relaxation times has been to use the atomistic resolution molecular dynamics
simulations to reproduce the measured changes and then analyze the dynamical changes from the simulation trajectory~\cite{feller02,eldho03,nowacka13}.
This approach has been especially useful in the studies of polyunsaturated acyl chain dynamics which concluded
by combining the simulation and NMR relaxation data that the double bonds speed us the chain dynamics
due to flexible dihedrals next to the double bonds~\cite{feller02,eldho03,gawrisch03,stillwell03}.

To ease the interpretation of the measured spin relaxation times Ferreira et al. recently introduced a model
free connection between effective correlation time and directly measurable spin relaxation rates~\cite{ferreira15}.
The main advantages of effective correlation time is that its connection to molecular dynamics is straightforward in
the sense that the general dynamics is faster when effective correlation time decreases and {\it vice versa} and
that it can be quantitatively compared to simulations. As shown in Fig.~\ref{RandEFFCT} these experiments
immediately show that the glycerol backbone has the slowest dynamics of lipid segments (in agreement with conclusions from the
combination of several previous experimental sets~\cite{leftin11}) and that the dynamics
of these is significantly underestimated by the Berger model.

Most importantly, the rough agreement of spin relaxation rates and effective correlation times between 
simulations and experiments shows that the rotational dynamical processes present in simulations has the 
correct order of magnitude~\cite{pastor88,lindahl01,pastor02,klauda08a,klauda08b,wohlert06,feller02,eldho03,ollila07a,klauda08b,klauda12,ferreira15}. 
Consequently, the dynamical visualizations of simulation trajectories 
(videos) can be considered as a realistic intuitive presentations of lipid bilayers. However,
in more detailed studies it should be kept in mind that all the dynamical (and also structural) details
are not exactly correct. 

The lipid rotational dynamics has been often interpreted by using the so called wobble in the cone model~\cite{pastor88,pastor02,klauda08a,klauda08c,sivanandam09}.
The main idea of the model is that the whole lipid molecule is wobbling as a cone such that all the
all the segments share the time scale for this wobbling. In addition, each segments have further timescales
related to their dynamincs inside the cone. The auto--correlation functions assuming the wobble in the cone
model can be nicely fit to the simulation data and also some experimental results can be reproduced. 
However, also auto--correlation functions having different type of dynamics can be used to do the same.
On the other hand, it has been recently pointed out that significant changes of structure and dynamics 
experienced in acyl chain region may not reflect to the headgroup~\cite{ferreiraTHESIS,botan15} indicating weak coupling 
between these segments. This idea is also in line with one possible interpretation of recent field cycling experiments~\cite{roberts09}.
In addition, the role of undulations in the relaxation data measured with low frequencies is under discussion~\cite{leftin11,edholm08,klauda08a,klauda08c}.

In conclusion, the timescale of rotational dynamics is correct in simulations while the exact correlation times
and relaxation processes are not fully reproduced. More experimental and simulation studies are needed 
to fully understand current quality of dynamics in current models. To interpretate the relaxation prcosesses
present in lipid bilayer, a model which can be shown to agree with experiments on all fast timescales is needed.

\section{Stucture factors from scattering and simulations}

\noindent {\bf For this section I would be more than happy for some help} \\[0.1cm]

\subsection{Form factor measured with X-ray or Neutron scattering}

In scattering experiments the scattering intensity $I(q)\sim|F(q)|^2S(q)$ is observed,
where $F(q)$ is the form factor and $S(q)$ is the structure factor. In the case of lipid
bilayer the structure factor describes the structure of lamellar sheets and the form factor
describes the internal structure of lipid bilayers. The structure factor depends on the
topological phase of lipids and can be considered to be practically constant for unilamellar
vesicles while in multilamellar phase its form is known. Thus, in practise direct
information about form factor is achieved from the measured scattering intensity.

Follwing the notation from Ref. \cite{kucerka10}, the form factor can be written as 
\begin{equation}\label{FF}
|F(q)|=|\int_{-D/2}^{D/2}(\sum_\alpha f_\alpha(q_z)n_\alpha(z) - \rho_s)(\cos(zq_z) + i \sin(zq_z)) {\rm d}z|,
\end{equation}
where $n_\alpha(z)$ in the atom $\alpha$ number density as a function of membrane normal coordinate $z$,
$f_\alpha(q_z)$ is the scattering length density, $\rho_s$ is the solvent scattering lenght density
and integral spans over bilayer with total thickness $D$.
Neutron scattering length density or X-ray atomic form factors are used for $f_\alpha(q_z)$ depending
on the used scattering technique. The values for these are available in the literature \cite{??}.
The last term disappers for symmetric bilayer but not for asymmetric \cite{??}.
If bilayer symmetry and delta functions for electron densities around atom center are assumed, the Eq. \ref{FF}
becomes to the commonly used form for x-ray scattering
\begin{equation}\label{FFsimpl}
|F(q)|=|\int_{-D/2}^{D/2}\Delta \rho_e(z) \cos(zq_z) {\rm d}z|,
\end{equation}
where $\Delta \rho_e(z)$ is the difference between solvent and the total electron densities.

\todo{Discussion about related issues can be found at:
{\tt https://github.com/NMRLipids/NMRLipids\_V-Review/issues/1}}

Form factors are quite accurate given that experimental care has been taken. A delicate issue 
can be subtraction of background (from water and capillary).  \\

Key questions now:\\
Do we get independetly measured Form Factors plotted to the same figure? \\
Are there good references for the accuracy?
}


\subsection{Form factor calculation from simulations}
To calculate the scattering form factors from simulations the number density from
simulations can be substituted into Eq. \ref{FF}. In the case of neutrons the scattering 
length densities $f_\alpha(q_z)$ are assumed to not depend on $q$ and numerical are usually 
taken from \cite{??}. For 

In the case of x-ray scattering this is the electron density profile along membrane normal.
Since electrons are not explicitly present in classical MD simulations, those exact locations
needs to be placed when calculating the electron density profile. The most common practise
is to assume that all the electrons belonging to each atom are pointwisely located at nucleus location
in the MD simulation \cite{??}. Electrons are also assumed to be distributed as gaussian \cite{??} or ? functions \cite{??}
around the atom positions. Very popular SimtoExp program uses the last approch \cite{??} while most 
molecular dynamics simulation modelling papers are using the first option \cite{??}. However,
the results are not expected to strongly depend on this choise since this affects only to very
fine details of the electron density profile and the thermal motion of atoms in MD simulations
will coarse the diffrences furhter \cite{??}.

The neutron scattering length density is typically calculated from atom positions using the
neutran scattering lenghts known for different atoms \cite{??}.

The most important question is now to check the discussion about undulations in the literature
}


\subsection{Interplay between simulations and scattering experiments: Validation and interpretation}
Similarly to NMR order parameter, the form factor gives accurate information about lipid
bilayer structure but the structure cannot be uniquely resolved from the experimental data only.
To solve the structure different models have been introduced \cite{??}. The general idea of
these models is to introduce plausible functional form for the scattering length density profile arising
from different molecular components of lipids and then fit the weights of these components such that
the experimental form factor is reproduced \cite{??}. Also MD simulations have been used in structural
interpretation \cite{??}. Also combination of other structural models and MD simulations have been used \cite{??}.

The stuctural models based on pure fitting to scattering data are shown to easily produce unphysical structures
arising from the fact that several scattering density distributions can produce correct form factors \cite{??}.
However, when the most obvious unphysicalities are removed, the models based on fitting produce form factors
with better agreeement with experiments than MD simulation models \cite{??}. Careful comparison
between structures from MD models and fittings to x-ray and neutron data shows that the structures 
from different approaches are very similar but not exatcly same \cite{??}. Differences are found
especially in the lipid headgroup region which is in agreement with the NMR order parameter studies
which has shown that glycerol backbone and choline structures are not reproduced within experimental
error in MD simulations \cite{botan15}.
  
Ideally the MD simulations would correctly reproduce the experimental form factors in zero tension
giving the atomistic resolution interpretation for the experiment and simultaneously confirming the
quality of the used model. This comparison is nowdays routinely done in almost all force field parametrization
publications instead of comparing area per molecules as previously done \cite{??}. 
The agreement is often concluded to be good, however, almost always detectable differences
between experiments and simulations can be seen \cite{??}. The attempts to run simulations 
with fixed area per molecule (generating tension in bilayer) in order or intepret the experiments
have shown that this can be improve the agreement, however, the models based on fitting gives
better agreement and slightly different structure \cite{??}. On the other hand, different simulation
models with different electron density profiles and form factors are concluded both to be in good 
agreement with experiments \cite{??}. This is possible since the absolute electron density is not
known from experiments and is thus fitted to the simulation results when comparing \cite{??}. 

In conclusion, all the state of the art simulation models gives form factor very close to experimental
data, however, it seems still the best agreement can be produced by fitting the scattering density models
to the experimental data \cite{??}. The problems to exactly reproduce the scattering data has been often 
related to the lipid headgroup structure which agrees with the conclusions from the NMR studies \cite{??}.

\section{Conclusions}

Recent studies quantitatively comparing atomistic resolution structure and dynamics of lipid
bilayer between experiments using C--H bond order parameters, spin relaxation rates and
scattering form factors are reviewed. The purpose of these studies is to quantify the atomistic
resolution structural and dynamical quality of simulation models as well as to give an 
atomistic resolution interpretation for the experimental results. For interpretation of
these experiments the atomistic resolution MD simulations reproducing all the experiments would be
an ultimate tool since the same model can be used to interpret all the experiments. For the same 
reason, this atomistic resolution model would be most likely a realistic representation for
atomistic resolution strucutre and dynamics of lipid bilayers. The main conclusion of this
review is that the current MD simulations are not quite yet on the level to perform this task,
however, in several aspects indicate that there is potential to improve the models to become 
truly realistic atomistic resolution representations of these systems. 

More specific conclusions are the following: \\
- The order parameters for each C--H bond in lipid molecules in bilayers can be measured
with high quantitative accuracy with both $ 2$H NMR and $ 13$C NMR and this data
is available for wide range of lipids in different conditions. Comparison of this data to simulations
gives a very detailed picture about the quality of sampled atomistic resolution structures
in lipid bilayer and may also help in structural interpretation of experiments. 
The order parameter changes with varying conditions can be used to study and compare structural changes
between simulations and experiments.\\
- The main conclusions from the comparison of order parameters between experiments and simulations are:
1) the acyl chain structures are generally described realistically for PC lipid bilayers in simulations, 
2) the changes in acyl chain region are qualitatively correct but not always quantitatively,
3) the glycerol backbone and choline structures are not within experimental error for any available model and
4) the results depending on structure and energetics of these sections, like ion binding and lipid--cholesterol interactions
should be taken with caution. \\
- The C--H bond rotational dynamics has correct timescale in simulations models for which comparison has been done.
Most likely the same applies for all models. However, more careful comparison reveals that, e.g. the
glycerol backbone dynamics is too slow in Berger model. Also for CHARMM model all relaxation prosess
do not seem to correctly described. \\
- The development in the scattering methodology has allowed the direct comparison of whole bilayer 
structure between experimental form factor and simulations. This is complementary to the NMR order parameter
which are related to the sampled structures of individual molecules. These comparisons show that the
structural lipid bilayer properties like thickness and area per molecule are close to real values, however,
it seems that there is room for improvement especially in the lipid headgroup region, in agreement with conclusions
from NMR experiments.  

When applying lipid bilayer simulations to study complicated biochemical systems it is crusial to recoknize 
potential artefacts arising from the inaccuracies revealed by these comparisons. Hyphotetical example of
a situation where artificial conclusions might be difficult to avoid would be study of protein approaching
PC lipid bilayer in physiological NaCl concentration. If the above mentioned issues are not carefully taken
into account one might choose a model where the protein is approaching an effectively positively charged 
lipid bilayer due to artificial Na$ +$ binding with incorrect choline structure. In addition to
