\section{Introduction}
\todo{Samuli: Add citations to the introduction}
Atomistic resolution molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers are nowdays
widely used technique to seek answer to various research questions.
Typically interactions between other biological molecules (e.g. proteins, drugs, ions etc.)
and lipids are studied but sometimes also lipid properties are directly under interest.
The questions are often biologically motivated and the atomistic resolutions simulations
gives very detailed information which is experimentally unattainable.

When simulations are used in this kind of studies, it is necessary to understand
the limitations of the method and also the accuracy of the used model.
In the pioneering atomistic resolution lipid bilayer simulations the quality of
the simulation respect to reality was measured mainly by comparing the 
acyl chain order parameters and area per molecule between experiments and
simulations. Especially some simulation models repruced these amazingly well
which led to the wide usage of these models.

Despite of the success of the models to reproduce the acyl chain properties and
molecular density more or less correctly, already early days it was pointed out
by comparing simulations to various experiments
that the glycerol backbone and choline headgroup order structure may not have been 
correctly described. However, at the time simulations were very short compared
to currently accessible timescles and it was not clear if the molecules had
time to sample all the states the model would predict. Also the method to 
quantitatively measure atomistic resolution molecular dynamics and compare to
simulations was not available, thus the real sampling timescales were not known.
For these reasons the estimates of the quality of headgroup were inconclusive on
the early days of molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers and
the issue has gained more attention only very recently.

While the C-H bond order parameters for all hydrocarbon segments are yet the
core parameter to quantify the lipid model quality, the area per molecule 
is quite generally replaced with form factor.
The main reason is that the area per molecule is calculated from the scattering
data using a model (set of assumptions). Thus, when this value is compared to
the value from simulations, the simulations are not compared directly to experiments
but to a value which comes from another model (set of assumptions to calculate the
area per molecule). For this reason the area per molecule is nowdays replaced
by comparison between form factor from simulations and x-ray or neutron scattering.

In this review we discuss the current state of the art methods to compare the 
atomistic resolution lipid structure and dynamics in simulations to the experiments. 
The C-H bond order parameters measured with NMR and form factors measured
with x-ray or neutron scattering are discussed for structural comparison,
and spin lattice relaxation rates for the comparison of dynamics.
The main advantages of these parameters are that
the experimental techiques are non-invansive, they are measured from multilamellar phase 
which is practically always present in simulations as well due to periodic boundary conditions
and that the compared quantity (order parameter, spin lattice relaxation and form factor) is achieved from 
the actual experimental data in a robust way. The experimental results from these
experimental techniques are also highly reproducible and the measured timescales
are appropriate for the comparison to simulations. Also several other experimental
parameters and techniques are used to quantify the simulation quality, however,
none of these is as robust as order parameters, spin relaxation rates or form factor. The most
commonly used other techniques are shortly discussed in the end of the review.

In this review we focus on phosphatidylcholine (PC) lipids which has been
in the focus of fundamental structural lipid studies for several decades now. However, there is a lot
data available and the basis of our approach applies to other lipid types as well~\cite{??}.

\subsection{Definition and properties of C-H bond order parameter}\label{OPdefinition}
In lipid bilayer systems the order parameter of a hydrocarbon C--H vector is typically defined as 
\begin{equation}\label{orderP}
S_{{\rm CH}}=\frac{1}{2}\langle 3 \cos^2 \theta-1 \rangle,
\end{equation} 
where the angle brackets denote an ensemble average over the sampled conformations, and $\theta$ is the 
angle between the C--H bond and the membrane normal.
The numerical values of order parameters vary between $-\frac{1}{2} < S_{{\rm CH}} < +1$
depending on the sampled $\theta$ distribution.
The definition is motivated by its connection to the dipolar and quadrupolar splitting measured with
$^1$H-$^{13}$C and $^2$H NMR techniques, respectively. The functional form comes from 
the fundamental theory of interactions between spin systems which gives a connection between 
average molecules orientations and NMR measurables~\cite{abragam}. 

If the sampled distribution of $\theta$ for a C--H bond are known, the order parameter
can be straighfowardly calculated from Eq. \ref{orderP}. However, the sampled $\theta$ 
distribtions cannot be uniquely determined from the known order parameter. Thus the experimental
order parameter values gives a set of conditions which structural molecular model 
(more specifically the C--H bond vectors of the model) has to fulfill
but the experimental order parameters alone cannot be used to uniquely 
resolve the structure. The same applies practically to all
experimental parameters used in biomolecular structure determination. 

Atomistic resolution molecular dynamic simulations naturally produces the
sampled structures from which the $\theta$ distributions can be calculated and
used in Eq.~\ref{orderP} to calculate the order parameters.
The sampled structures in the simulation can considered to be realistic
only if the experimental order parameters are reproduced.
If this is the case, the simulation can be then considered 
as an atomistic resolution interpretation of experimental order parameters.
Before MD simulations were feasible for such usage, other models have been used for this interpretation~\cite{??}.
It is important to note, however, that the sampled structures which reproduce the order parameters are not 
necessarily the correct ones since, in principle, several structural models can produce the same order parameters. 
Significant advance of the MD models compared to the traditional models is that the same MD 
structures can be straightforwardly compared to other experimental observables in addition to order parameters, 
like $^{31}$P chemical shift anisotropy~\cite{chowdhary13}, $^{31}$P-$^{13}$C dipolar couplings~\cite{prakash10}
and scattering data~\cite{??}. This will significantly reduce the 
possibility of getting unrealistic structures reproducing correct order parameters.

The probability for unrealistic structures with correct order order parameters is further reduced by
the detailed and accurate experimental data available for order parameters.
Order parameters are known with high quantitative accuracy for each C-H bond present in the lipid molecule
for several lipid types~\cite{??}. The absolute values of order parameters can be measured two independent
techniques by using either $^2$H NMR~\cite{seelig77c} or $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13} and
the sign can be measured with two different $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR techniques~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}.
It is also possible that two hydrogen bonds in the same carbon has different order parameters ({\it forking})
which can be detected with both $^2$H NMR~\cite{??} and $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR~\cite{??} techniques.
As a result, for example for POPC lipid molecule in lipid bilayer there is ? order parameter numbers
known experimentally and a structural model for this lipid should reproduce all of these.
If some the order parameters are not reproduced, it is easy to detect the weak parts of the model
since a single order parameter is very local quantity depending only on the position of two atoms (C-H pair).
This is an advance over several other accurately measured NMR quantities, 
like $^{31}$P chemical shift anisotropy~\cite{chowdhary13} and $^{31}$P-$^{13}$C dipolar couplings~\cite{prakash10}
which depend on the position of several atoms, thus in the case of disagreement, it is more difficult 
to pinpoint the problems in the model.

%if discprepancy is found in order parameter related to certain bond it is known that the model has problems
%in the orientation of this specific bond. This gives order parameters a significant advance over, e.g. other
%accurate NMR obervables like ??. These can be also used to quantify the structural quality, however, in the
%case of disagreement the problem points in the model are more difficult to localize.


%In sections~\ref{??} and~\ref{??} we review the most relevant experimental and molecular dynamics simulation aspects related to the usage of
%order parameters in order to interpret the atomistic resolution structure of lipid bilayers. In section~\ref{??} we
%discuss the connection between structure and order parameters.





 

\subsection{Order parameters from $^2$H NMR experiments}

The absolute values of order parameters are connected to the quadrupolar splitting $\Delta \nu_Q$ ($^2$H NMR) 
measured in $^2$H NMR experiments through the equation 
\begin{equation}\label{HNMRop}
|S_{{\rm CD}}|=\frac{4}{3} \frac{h}{e^2qQ} \Delta \nu_{{\rm Q}}, 
\end{equation}
where $e$ is the elementary charge, $Q$ is the deuteron quadrupole moment and $h$ is the Planck's constant. 
The parameter $q$ is related to the largest electric field gradient and in practise its value is not known; 
therefore the static quadrupolar coupling constant $\frac{e^2qQ}{h}$ is defined, and its value measured for 
different compounds in their solid state ($\Delta \nu_Q$ measurement from the system where order parameter is known to be 1). 
In C-D order parameter measurements for lipids, it is typical to 
use the value measured for different alkenes, $\frac{e^2qQ}{h}$=170 kHz. The relation between order parameters 
and quadrupolar splittings then becomes $S_{{\rm CD}}=0.00784 \times \Delta \nu_{{\rm Q}}$.
This relation is useful as many publications report only the quadrupolar splittings. For a review and more accurate description see the work of Seelig~\cite{seelig77c}.

\subsection{Order parameters from $^{13}$C NMR experiments}

To determine order parameter with $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR experiments, the dipolar splitting $\Delta \nu_\mathrm{CH}$  is measured. This is then related to
the effective dipolar coupling $d_\mathrm{CH}$ through a scaling factor depending on the pulse sequence used in the 
experiment~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13}. The effective dipolar coupling $d_{{\rm CH}}$ is 
connected to the absolute value of order parameter through equation
\begin{equation}\label{CNMRop}
|S_{{\rm CH}}|=(\frac{D_{{\rm max}}}{2\pi})^{-1}d_\mathrm{CH},
\end{equation}
where $D_{{\rm max}} = \frac{\hbar \mu_0 \gamma_h \gamma_c}{4\pi\langle r_\mathrm{CH}^3 \rangle}$. 
$r_{{\rm CH}}$ is the C-H distance, $\mu_0$ is the vacuum permittivity, and $\gamma_h$ and $\gamma_c$ are 
the gyromagnetic constants for $^1$H and $^{13}$C nuclei. In contrast to Eq.~\ref{HNMRop}, all the parameters in 
Eq.~\ref{CNMRop} are in principle known. However, for the internuclear distance only the average $⟨r_{{\rm CH}}⟩$ 
is known, not the third moment $⟨r^3_{{\rm CH}}⟩$. For this reason values between 20.2-22.7 kHz are used for
$\frac{D_{{\rm max}}}{2\pi}$ depending on the original authors~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,becker06,ferreira13,ferreira15}.

\subsection{Quantitative accuracy of experimental order parameter values}

It must be stressed that $^2$H NMR and $^{13}$C NMR are fully independent experiments since the deuterium quadrupolar splitting $\Delta \nu_Q$
and the dipolar splitting $d_{{\rm CH}}$ are different physical observables. In addition, the prefactors connecting the observables to the order 
parameter (Eqs.~\ref{HNMRop} and~\ref{CNMRop}) are independently measured. Further independent experiments are performed With $^{13}$C NMR 
by measuring the $^1$H-$^{13}$C dipolar couplings using different pulse sequences~\cite{hong95a,gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13} when the connection
between dipolar splitting $d_{{\rm CH}}$ and effective dipolar coupling $d_\mathrm{CH}$ is different.

The measurements of quadrupole $\Delta \nu_Q$ and dipolar $d_{{\rm CH}}$ splittings are relatively accurate, especially for quadrupolar splitting.
\todo{How accurate exactly?} 
Thus the quantitative accuracy of measured order parameters is mainly determined by the  
prefactors connecting the measured splittings to the order parameters (Eqs.~\ref{HNMRop} and~\ref{CNMRop}). 
Since the prefactors are independently determined for the $^2$H and $^{13}$C NMR measurements,
the quantitative accuracy is best estimated by comparing the independtly measured order parameter values.

The comparisons between order parameters measured with $^2$H NMR and $^{13}$C NMR by several authors
shows very good agreement~\cite{gross97,dvinskikh05a,ferreira13, botan15}.
Botan et al. collected literature values for PC lipid choline headgroup and glycerol backbone order parameters 
and concluded that order parameters would be known with the accuracy of $\pm$0.02 for these segments in purified PC lipid bilayer samples~\cite{botan15}
which agrees with the estimate of Gross et al~\cite{gross97}. 
The lower order parameter reported in some studies~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,warschawski05} were suggested to arise from lower experimental accuracy.
The values collected by Botan et al. and the suggested sweet spots where choline and glycerol backbone order parameters should fall in the 
simulation models are shown in Fig.~\ref{allOPs} A).

Acyl chain order parameters from different techniques are compared in Table 1 by Gross et al.~\cite{gross97}, 
Dvinskikh et al.~\cite{dvinskikh05a} and Ferreira et al.~\cite{ferreira13}. The comparison by Ferreira et al.~\cite{ferreira13} 
is also shown in Fig.~\ref{allOPs} C). Generally good agreement between different methods is seen also for
acyl chain order parameters, however, for some segments the 0.02 accuracy might not be achieved.
\todo{Maybe specify to which ones?}.

%In conclusion, comparing the order parameters measured with different techniques based on different physical interactions 
%the accuracy of the prefactors can be estimated. Since the order parameters from different techniques are 
%almost always within $\pm$0.02 this can be considered to be the quantitative accuracy of the measurements.


\subsection{Qualitative accuracy of experimental order parameter values}

When order parameters are measured as function of changing condition (e.g. temperature, hydration level, ion concentration, etc.), 
the prefactors connecting the order parameter and the experimentally measured couplings can be considered 
to be unchanged. Therefore, accuracy of the measured change is determined by the accuracy of the splitting measurement
in contrast to the previous section. Here we refer to this as a qualitative accuracy. Due to the high resolution of
splitting measurements, especially in $ 2$H NMR, the qualitative accuracy is much higher than the
quantitative accuracy discussed in previous section.

The high qualitative accuracy of $ 2$H NMR experiments is exemplified in Fig. \ref{??} by using the
the classical experiment by Akutsu and Seelig~\cite{akutsu81}, where the effect of different ions on 
the quadrupolar splittings of choline headgroup $\alpha$ and $\beta$ segments was measured, 
\footnote{These changes were later shown to be consistent with the addition of different charges into the bilayer, and the electrometer 
concept was introduced to measure the amount of charge incorporated in the bilayer interface~\cite{scherer89}.}
see Fig.~\ref{QUADsplitIONeffect}. 
The effects of different ions on the quadrupole splittings are clearly differentiable with the experimental 
accuracy in Fig.~\ref{QUADsplitIONeffect} A). However, when transformed to the order parameter units, 
these changes correspond only changes below 0.03 units for $\beta$ and 0.05 for $\alpha$ as shown in 
Fig.~\ref{QUADsplitIONeffect} B). 
\begin{figure*}[]
%  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=17.2cm]{../Fig/QPandOPwithIONS.eps}
  \caption{\label{opIONeffect}
    A) Quadrupolar splittings as function of different ion concetrations measured by Akutsu and Seelig with $^2$H NMR~\cite{akutsu81}. 
    B) The data from A) translated to order parameters ($S_{{\rm CD}}=0.00784 \times \Delta \nu_{{\rm Q}}$). Also the sign of $\beta$ order parameter is put negative according
    to more recent experiments~\cite{??} (see also Ref.~\cite{botan15} and Section~\ref{??}).
  } 
\end{figure*}

%The resolution of $^{13}$C NMR experiment depends somewhat on the pulse sequence used. 
As another example of the high qualitative accuracy of order parameter experiments, the measured order parameters
for $\beta$ and $\alpha$ carbons as a function of hydration level for different PC lipids are shown in 
Fig.~\ref{opDEHYDeffect}. Quantitative numbers from different experiments show slight variation between
different temperatures and lipid compositions. However, in all experiments the
order parameters increase with decreasing hydration.
\footnote{This increase is related to the P-N vector tilting more parallel to the membrane plane \cite{botan15}
which is in agreement with electrometer concept suggesting that penetrating charge has opposite 
effect on headgroup tilt leading to decrease of order parameters \cite{scherer89,ionpaper}.}
The smallest order parameter change is only slightly above 0.01 units, measured by Dvinskikh et al. 
with $ 13$C NMR~\cite{dvinskikh05b}, demonstrating that high qualitative accuracy can be
also achieved with $ 13$C NMR. 
\begin{figure}[]

  \includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{../Fig/OrderParameterDEHYDexp.eps}

    Also the sign of $\beta$ order parameter is put negative according
    to more recent experiments~\cite{??} (see also Ref.~\cite{botan15} and Section~\ref{??}).
  } 
\end{figure}

In conclusion, the experimental qualitative accuracy order parameter measurements is very high.
It is much higher than the accuracy achieved with state of the art MD simulations.
Thus, the accuracy order parameter change comparison between simulations and experiments is
limited by the simulation accuracy, not experimental. 

On the other hand, it should be noted that since even very small splitting changes can 
be detected experimentally one should always connect these to the changes in real molecules
to avoid overinterpretation. For example, it has been measured that cholesterol induces 
a measurable change in ? quadrupolar splitting which is ? \cite{??}. This may tempt to conclude that
cholesterol affects to the choline structure, however, this quadrupolar splitting corresponds
? unit change in the order parameter which indicates almost negligible conformational change \cite{botan15}.


\subsection{Signs of order parameters}

While only the absolute values of order parameters are accessible with $^2$H NMR, two different 
$^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR techniques allow also the measurement of the sign: 
first Hong et al. first measured order parameter signs for eggPC~\cite{hong95a} and DMPC~\cite{hong95b}; 
then later Gross et al. used a different NMR technique to measure signs for DMPC~\cite{gross97}. 
All the experiments report negative order parameters for almost all the segments, only $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are positive.

Furthermore, the signs~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}  and magnitudes~\cite{gally81,ferreira13,botan15} of choline headgroup 
and glycerol backbone order parameters are practically unaffected by the acyl tail contents of the bilayers. 
Thus, it can be fairly assumed that the order parameter signs for these segments are the same in all PC lipids in bilayer. 
On the other hand, the positive signs for g$_1$, g$_3$ and C$_2$ has been reported by Aussenac et al.~\cite{aussenac03} 
which has led to some confusion in comparison between simulations and experiments~\cite{hogberg08}. 
However, these signs are not directly measured but extracted from the model used to interpret 
$^2$H NMR order parameters from DMPC bicelles. Thus, it is reasonable conclude that 
order parameters are negative for all segments except for $\alpha$ and $\gamma$, as 
directly measured with $^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}.

Even though the sign was not measurable with $^2$H NMR, the sign was believed to be negative for acyl chains because $\theta$ was expected to fluctuate 
around 90$^o$ leading to negative order parameters~\cite{seelig77c}. This was later confirmed by using $^{13}$C NMR measurements~\cite{hong95a}. 
Also MD simulations always produce negative order parameters for acyl chains.

%In conclusion, it seems reasonable to assume that the signs measured with $^{13}$C NMR methods~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}
%can be used for all PC lipids in bilayer, i.e. the signs for almost all the carbons are negative, only  $\alpha$ and $\gamma$ are positive.

Typically when the response of order parameters to varying conditions (ions, dehydration and cholesterol) is measured, only the absolute 
values are reported~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84,bechinger91,ulrich94,dvinskikh05b,ferreira13}. Where clear responses are observed, 
like with multivalent ions~\cite{akutsu81,altenbach84} and dehydration~\cite{bechinger91,ulrich94,dvinskikh05b}, the experiments are done by gradually 
changing the conditions and the order parameter response is systematic, see Figs.~\ref{opIONeffect} and~\ref{opDEHYDeffect}. 
Thus, it is reasonable to assume that also the signs are not suddenly changing. However, it seems that the sign of 
the $\alpha$ carbon order parameter does change in response to a large amount of bound charge, such as multivalent ions. In this case, 
the absolute value of the order parameter first decreases to zero and then starts to increase again~\cite{altenbach84,seelig87}, 
as seen from the nicely illustrated spectra shown Fig.~\ref{qsCACLeffect} by Altenbach et al.~\cite{altenbach84}.
\begin{figure}[]
%  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{../Fig/QUADsplitCACLeffect.eps}

    Quadrupolar splitting $\Delta \nu_Q$ of $\alpha$ of POPC as a function of CaCl$_2$ concentration, related to the order parameter as $S_{{\rm CD}}=0.00784 \times \Delta \nu_Q$. 
    We know nowadays that the order parameter of $\alpha$ in the absense of CaCl$_2$ is positive~\cite{hong95a,hong95b,gross97}.
    Thus, the most obvious interpertation for the result is that the $\alpha$ order parameter decreases to zero when CaCl$_2$ concentration reaches 2.0M, and 
    above these concentrations becomes increasingly negative with further addition of CaCl$_2$. Reprinted with permission from Altenbach and Seelig, Biochemistry, 23, 3913 (1984). Copyright 1984 American Chemical Society.

\subsection{Forking of order parameters}

It is possible that the CH$_2$ segment is sampling such orientations that the order parameters
for different hydrogens in the same carbon have different values. We call this phenomena as 
{\it forking}, as done also previously to avoid confusion with splittings measured with NMR.
The forking is detected with both $^2$H NMR~\cite{seelig75,seelig78,engel81,gally81} and 
$^1$H-$^{13}$C NMR techniques~\cite{??} as two different quadrupolar or dipolar splitting values,
respectively, related to the same CH$_2$ segment.

The forking is observed for g$_1$, g$_3$, and  C$_2$ carbon in the \textit{sn}-2 chain segments in
a fluid PC lipid bilayer, for other CH$_2$ segments the equal order parameters are observed for 
both hydrogens are equal~\cite{seelig74,seelig77,seelig78,gally81,ferreira13,??}.
The forking has been studied in detail with $^2$H NMR techniques by separately deuterating the 
R or S position in CH$_2$ segment to assign order parameters to correct hydrogens \cite{gally81}.
\todo{Has this been done for the C$_2$ carbon in the \textit{sn}-2 chain?}

$^2$H NMR studies also show that the forking really arises from differently sampled orientations 
of the two C--H bonds, not from two separate populations of lipid conformations~\cite{engel81,gally81}.
This means that realistic atomistic resolution molecular models has to reproduce the forking 
correctly. Thus, the simulated order parameters has to be calculated separately for each hydrogen
by taking into account the isomeric position for the structural comparison to the experimentals.
Recent work by Botan et al. shows that several simulation models has problems in this respect \cite{botan15}
(see also Fig. \ref{??}). 


\subsection{Order parameter values in the literature}
For $^2H$ NMR measurements the CH$_2$ segments has to be labeled with deuterium.
This can be done specifically for a certain segment or for the several segments
simultaneously \cite{??}. In the first case, it is known that the measured
order parameter (quadrupolar splitting) is related to the labeled segment.
In the latter case several order parameters (quadrupolar splittings) are
measured which arise from all the labeled segments, however, it is not known 
which order parameter belongs to which segment. Majority of the $^2H$ NMR data
in the literature is measured from samples with perdeuterated acyl chain \cite{leftin11}
since the synthesis of specifically deuterated lipids is complicated \cite{??} and they are expensive.
From this kind of data alone one cannot know which order parameter is assigned
to which CH$_2$ segment. On the other hand, also order parameter data from specifically 
deuterated lipids are available from several lipid types in various 
conditions \cite{seelig74,seelig75,seelig77,seelig78,gally81}.

Specific labeling is not needed for order parameter measurement with $^{13}$C NMR due the 
natural abundance of $ {13}$C, however it could be used to enhance the signal for specific 
segment under interest \cite{??}. Order parameter measurements with $^{13}$C NMR are
2D experiments, the chemical shift being in the first dimension and dipolar coupling 
in the second \cite{??}. The chemical shift depends on the local chemical environment and 
is different for each carbon segment. In the second dimension the dipolar coupling
(order parameter) corresponding each chemical shift value is measured, and its value 
can be connected, in principle, to each carbon segment by using the chemical shift value.  
In practise, challenges occur in the acyl chain region where chemical shift values 
of different segments are very close to each others \cite{??}. This issue has been
addressed by filtering the spectra by using partially deuterated lipids \cite{ferreira13}
and using data from simulations and specifically deuterated experiments to help in 
the assigment \cite{ferreira13,??}. It should be noted that the overlapping spectra 
is a challenge only for acyl chain regions with several similar segments. On the other hand, 
the order parameters for hydrocarbon segments in choline, glycerol backbone, close to the 
double bonds, and in the beginning and the end of acyl chains can be straighforwardly 
measured from the natural abundance lipid samples. 

The order parameters are typically measured from multilamellar samples which are good for comparison to MD 
simulations since it a nearest experimental correspondence for a simulation box with periodic boundary conditions. 
In this work we do not discuss order parameters can be measured also from other type of samples, 
e.g. bicelles~\cite{aussenac03,raffard00,sanders92}, or indirect measurements by using, e.g. relaxation
data~\cite{??} since their comparison to simulations is less straightforward.  

The available experimental data for order parameters is reviewed
quite recently~\cite{leftin11,marsh13}. These reviews are comprehensive especially for 
acyl chains in pure lipid bilayer samples. In addition to this, there is significant
amount of order parameter data for glycerol backbone and headgroup segments \cite{botan15}, and
also data as a function of changing conditions for all lipid segments \cite{??}.
The amount of data, especially from $^{13}$C NMR, has been also increasing lately~\cite{ferreira13,leftin??,??}.
Especially the order parameter data of headgroup responses to varying conditions 
has a lot of unused pontential since it can used to measure, e.g. ion partitioning to lipid
bilayer \cite{??,ionpaper} and lipid protein interactions \cite{??}. Simultaneously, it
gives accurate experimental parameters which can be directly compared to MD simulations \cite{botan15,iopaper}.



\subsection{Order parameters from simulations}
In molecular dynamics simulations the trajectories of each atom as a function of time 
are solved by using the Newton's equation of motion and the parameters describing the 
forces between atoms (force field). Also the thermal motion is included in the simulations, thus 
the molecules are expected to sample the realistic phase space during the simulation.
Since the coordinates of all atoms are known from the simuation trajectory,
the order parameters can calculated directly using the definition of Eq.~\ref{orderP}
for each hydrocarbon segment. 

For simulations models without explicit hydrogen atoms 
(united atom models), the hydrogen positions can be generated post-simulationally from 
the positions of the heavy atoms and the known hydrocarbon geometries.
Alternatively, the equations 
??
can be used to calculate the order parameters directly.
These two approaches are almost identical and give essentially the 
same results. However, the Eq.~\ref{??} is valid only for the case where there is no
forking, i.e. order parameters are equal for both hydrogens attached to the 
same carbon.

In general the order parameters for the acyl chain reported from the same
models by different authors are in good agreement in the literature.
The exeption is, however, the order parameters for C-H order parameters
which are calculated incorrectly by the {\it g\_order} program which
is part of the Gromacs package. This discrepancy can be seen
for example by comparing the order parameters between ? (calculated with {\it g\_order}) and ?
(calculated with Eq.~\ref{??} and generating hydrogen positions with {\it protonate}) for
oleyl chain of POPC. In some cases the order parameters are also formally reported 
to be positive~\cite{??}. However, in these cases it almost certain that negative values are
actually achieved from actual calculations. Most likely explanation for reported positive 
values are the missing absolute value lines from the figure label, or the confusion arising
from the fact that the {\it g\_order} gives actually -S$_{{\rm CH}}$.
By takig into account the above mentioned and well understood issues, 
the simulation order parameters for acyl chain in literature are in good
agreement with each others and simulations.

Especially the generally good quantitative agreement between experimental and simulated
order parameters in acyl chain region for pure lipid bilayers (except for C$_2$ segment in sn-2 chain) should be emphasized.
This means that the atomistic resolution structures sampled by the acyl chains are correct
with high probability in the simulations and that the simulations give better and more illustrative
description on acyl chain conformations than the traditionally build models based on NMR data. 
In addition to the quantitatively good agreement in pure bilayers, the changes in 
acyl chain order parameters as a function of changing conditions are generally reasonable.
For example, increase of order parameters as a function of cholesterol concetration and with 
hydration are reproduced in simulations. In contrast the decrease due to addition of
double bonds is also reproduced. It should be noted, however, that the quantitative changes
are often not reproduced correctly when compared. This indicates that even though
the models reproduce atomistic resolution changes into the correct direction, 
the changes are often over or underestimated. There is room for improvement
in the models in this respect. However, in conclusion, the acyl chain 
structure and its qualitative changes are generally well described by the
molecular dynamics simulations and this is one of biggest achievements of the
field, and also one of the most important justification for the usage of such models.

There is more discrepancies in the order parameters and their interpretation reported for glycerol backbone and
choline in the literature. In recent publication from the NMRLipids project~\ref{botan15} the results 
from 12 different models were calculated and compared to the experiments, see Fig.~\ref{HGorderparameters}. 
\begin{figure}[]

} 
\end{figure}
In this study significant differences in order parameters and structures were observed between the models,
however, none of the models reproduced the order parameters within experimental error.
This indicates that the simulations models are not in the level that those could be used to
study the glycerol backbone or choline structrure, or phenoma related to their strucuture or
energetics. Despite of the incorrect structures in simulation models the qualitative
responses to the dehydration and charge penetration were qualitatitevly correct. 
However, the ion partition coefficient was significantly off from experiments in
several models. Also the effect of cholesterol on glycerol backbone was overestimated
by the most used model. The conclusions from NMRLipids project and the reported 
numbers differ from some earlier investigations. Some studies have interpreted
essentially same simuation results to be in good agreement with experiments~\cite{??}.
This difference in interpretation seems to arise from the underestimated accuracy
of experimental order parameters. On the other hand, some studies report different
order parameter values than Botan et al. for the same models~\cite{??}.
However, in these studies the order parameter signs and forking are not carefully analyzed
which probably explains the differences. It should be noted that all the data
and analysis by Botan et al. is openly available, so their calculations can 
be carefully re-examinated, which is not the case for other studies.

The statistical error estimates of simulated order parameters are systematically
small. The error of the mean calculated averaging ove time blocks~\cite{ollila07}, independent 
simulations~\cite{poger12} or different lipids~\cite{botain15} all give maximum error $\sim \pm$0.01.

It has been pointed out recently that the sampling of individual dihedral angles might be very
slow compared to the typical (100~ns) simulation timescales~\cite{vogel12}.
After 200~ns, however, even the slowest rotational correlation function of a C--H bond  (g$_1$) reaches
a plateau ($S_\mathrm{CH}^2$) in the Berger model~\cite{berger97}---and, notably,
the dynamics of this segment have been shown to be significantly slower in simulations
than in experiments~\cite{ferreira15}.
In practise,
due to averaging over different lipid molecules,
less than 200~ns of simulation data should be enough for the order parameter calculation;
if the sampling within typical simulation times
is not enough for the convergence of the order parameters,
then the simulation model in question has unphysically slow dynamics.



\subsection{Interplay between simulations and NMR order parameters: Validation and interpretation}

In the above sections we review the accuracy and availability of NMR order parameters in simulations and experiments.
We have concluded that the order parameters for each segments of phospholipids in lipid bilayer are achievable
with high accuracy from simulations and experiments, and also lot of these values are already available 
in the literature. The experimental order parameter give very detailed and local information about the orientations
sampled by each C--H bonds in the lipid bilayer system. However, the structure cannot be resolved only by using 
experimental order parameters since several $\theta$ angle (in Eq.~\ref{??}) distributions produces the same
order parameter and not all segments of lipid molecule contains C--H groups (e.g. phosphate). 
Historically several modeling techniques have been used to suggest structures which reproduce the 
experimental order parameters, thus being realistic candidates for the atomistic resolution structure
of lipids~\cite{??}. This has turned out to be extremely difficult task and unambigous solution has not
been reached, although some details are agreed~\cite{??}.

The atomistic resolution molecular dynamics simulations of lipid bilayers gives automatically the 
atomistics resolution structure of lipids sampled in a bilayer. Since the order parameters can 
be calculated from these simulations with high accuracy, those can be compared to the experimental
values. If the order parameters agree within experimental error, the simulated structures are realistic
and can be considered as an interpretation of experimental numbers. 
It should be noted, however, that even if the order parameters would be reproduced, it does not, in principle, 
guarantee that the structures are correct. Further test can be done by using further dipolar coupling~\cite{??}
and scattering data, see Section~\ref{??}.
If the simulated order 
parameter do not fit inside the experimental error bars, the simulation do not sample correct
atomistic conformations and the simulation methdology and model should be reconsidered.

As discussed in the previous section, many (if not all) simulations models have serious difficulties
to reproduce the glycerol backbone and choline headgroup structure and energetics, their response
to the cholesterol and ion concentrations. This indicates that the reliability of most simulation results 
reported in the literature regarding these issues are not reliable and that the modelling of these
parts should be paid more effort before the quantitative structural intepretation becomes possible.
Despite of the problems, the qualitative response of headgroup to the dehydration and penetrating ions
was correct which confirmed the connection between increasing choline $\alpha$ and $\beta$ order parameters
and increasing P--N vector angle respect to the membrane normal ~\cite{??} suggested previously in~\cite{??}.

As also discussed in the previous section the simulation methods have been much more successfull in describing
the acyl chain region of lipid bilayer. Almost all simulation models are able to reproduce acyl chain
order parameters with the very good accuracy, exception being the C$_2$ segment in the sn-2 chain.
Also the changes induced in acyl chain region are reproduced well, at least qualitatively.
Thus the sampled acyl chain structures given by simulations can be considered to be reasonable
interpretation for experimental acyl chain order parameter measurements. 

This is a significant advancement to the traditional structural models build based on the 
fittings to the order paramters. The dynamical visualization of simulation trajectory immediately 
reveals very dynamical nature of acyl chains, rapidly sampling large amount of different conformations 
(for dynamics see the Section~\ref{??}). These dynamical visualizations gives significantly better
intuitive understanding of dynamical nature of lipid bilayers compared to the static ones from 
traditional models. Since the lipid bilayers can be considered as a simplistic models for cell
membranes and other biological lipid layers, this understanding has significant impact on
biophysics and biochemistry. 

In addition, the simulations have been useful in understanding the effect of changes induced 
in the acyl chain region. For example, the decrease of order parameters due to double bonds 
has been reproduced in several simulations models with very good or decent accuracy~\cite{??}.
These simulations has been then used to shown that the double bonds induce more disordered
and fluid bilayer due to the more flexible dihedral potentials next to the rigid double bonds~\cite{??}.
In this respect the simulations showed significant advancement compared to the traditional 
approaches~\cite{??}. Also, increased acyl chain order and related thickening
of lipid bilayers due to addition of cholesterol is generally reproduced by simulations giving
also intuitive visualizations for these effects~\cite{??}. However, in this case the 
strength and molecular details of this effect may not fully agree with experiments in all models
indicating that there is still room for iprovement in lipid-cholesterol interactions in lipid
models~\cite{??}.

Simulation studies have also predicted changes in acyl chain region which are not yet experimentally 
confirmed, e.g. disordering induced by the lipid oxidation~\cite{??}. A new experimental data
can confirm if these predictions can be verified. In contrast to the glycerol bakcbone and headgroup~\cite{??},
serious simulation artefacts in the acyl chain region in the state of the art simulation models are
not reported. 

In conclusion, the detailed comparison of atomistic resolution structures of lipids in bilayer between 
simulations and reality has revealed that the acyl chain region is generally well described in simulations
and has provided new information about lipid structures. In contrast, significant problems
in glycerol backbone and headgroup region are observed which has led to questionable conclusions~\cite{??}.

\todo{This is quite straightforward to write for me and there is quite good support from our recent work~\cite{ferreira15}.
I will write the first version as soon as I can.}

\subsection{Definition and properties of rotational autcorrelation function}
The second order auto-correlation function for the reorientation of the C--H chemical bond axis is defined as \cite{Lip82:4546}
\begin{equation}\label{gt}
g(\tau) = \langle P_2[\vec{\mu}(t)\cdot\vec{\mu}(t+\tau)]\rangle,
\end{equation} 
where $P_2$ denotes the second Legendre polynomial, $P_2(\xi) = 1/2 (3\xi^2 - 1)$, $\vec{\mu}(t)$ is the unitary vector having the 
direction of the C--H bond at time $t$, and the angular brackets denote a time-average. This autocorrelation is usually chosen
to describe the C--H bond rotational dynamics since it is connected to the experimentally measurable spin relaxation rates 
through its Fourier transformation called spectral density
\begin{equation}\label{FT}
j(\omega) =  2\int_0^{\infty} \cos(\omega \tau) g(\tau) d\tau.
\end{equation}
In this review we focus only on experiments measured from multilamellar samples with randomly oriented sheets, 
hus only the second order auto-correlation function is needed~\cite{??}. 

In randomly oriented multilamellar samples the auto--correlation function of bond orientations always decays to zero with
long enough time scales. However, the relaxation timescales can be divided to two distinct timescales.
First the relaxation processes shorter than microsecond timescales occurs when lipid molecules are reorienting
in the lipid bilyer but are not essentially moving between lipid bilayer regions with different orientations.
Then with larger than microsecond timescales the movement between differently oriented bilayer regions
decays the rotational correlation function to zero. In addition, MAS experiments the sample spinning
causes lead orientaitional relaxation in kHz region. The full auto--correlation decaying to zero 
is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{correlationF}. Due to the timescale separation the correlation function can 
be written as~\cite{Now10:16848}
\begin{equation}\label{corrF}
g(\tau)=g_{\rm{f}}(\tau) g_{\rm{s}}(\tau);
\end{equation}
$g_{\rm{f}}(\tau)$ describes the decay of $g(\tau)$ due to fast molecular motions and $g_{\rm{s}}(\tau)$ contains the contribution from slower motions
\begin{equation}\label{MAS}
g_{\rm{s}}(\tau)= e^{- \frac{\tau}{\tau_{\rm{s}}}} \bigg[ \frac{2}{3}\cos(\omega_R \tau) + \frac{1}{3}\cos(2\omega_R \tau)\bigg],
\end{equation}
where $\tau_s$ is a correlation time due to slower isotropic molecular motions originating from the diffusion between bilayers 
with different orientations of their principal symmetry axis, and the cosine terms are the contribution from magic angle spinning 
of the sample, rotating at $\omega_{\rm{R}}/2\pi$ cycles per second~\cite{Hir06:307}, typically in the kHz frequency range. 

%We expect 
%a two step model behavior \cite{Hal81:1928} of the correlation function $g(\tau)$ as illustrated in Figure \ref{correlation_function} 
%and described as follows. First, $g(\tau)$ will decay due to fast anisotropic molecular motions to a plateau value equal to the square 
%of the order parameter $S_{\rm{CH}}=\langle P_2(\cos\theta)\rangle$, where $\theta$ denotes the angle between the C--H bond and the bilayer 
%normal. $|S_{\rm{CH}}|$ can be accurately measured by a number of NMR techniques~\cite{Lef11:818}. 
%At much longer time scales,  $g(\tau)$ will then oscillate due to MAS and relax to zero because of slower isotropic motions. Since Pake 
%pattern line shapes with splittings $\Delta\nu$ from a few to tens of kHz can be measured for lipid bilayers \cite{Lef11:818,Dav83:117}, 
%the time scale for these isotropic slow motions must be much slower than $1/\Delta\nu$, or deviations from such Pake patterns would be 
%detectable~\cite{Jag87:167}. Thus $g(\tau)$ will only start to decay from the plateau $S_{\rm{CH}}^2$  at time scales well above $\mu$s.


The order parameter measurements with $^2$H NMR and $^{13}$C NMR measure the bond order after the relaxation
of rotational motion inside the bilayer plane but before the relaxation between different bilayer orientations,
as illustrated in Fig.~\ref{??}. In typical molecular dynamics simulations with periodic boundary conditions
the lipid molecules are restricted to single bilayer orientation and also the timescales are currently
typically below microsecond. In these simulations the auto--correlation function in Eq.~\ref{??} decays
to the square of order parameter in Eg.~\ref{??} in bilayers with planar symmetry, i.e. no microscopic phase separation of defects present.
Also this is illustrated in Fig.~\ref{??}.
\begin{figure}[]
%  \centering
  \includegraphics[width=8.6cm]{../Fig/correlationF.eps}

  \caption{\label{correlationF}
    (Top) Illustration of the auto-correlation function g(τ) and effective
correlation time τe for a C–H bond in a lipid or surfactant bilayer. Magicangle

} 
\end{figure}

The rotational correlation function describes how long does it take for a single molecule
on average to sample the conformations. The effective correlation time 
\begin{equation}\label{effCTdef}
\tau_{e}:=\int_0^{\infty} \frac{g_{\rm{f}}(\tau)-S_{\rm{CH}}^2}{1-S_{\rm{CH}}^2} \mathrm{d}\tau
\end{equation} 
can be used as an intuitively useful single parameter to describe this time. 
The larger this parameter is, the longer it takes in average to sample the conformations related to the
bond. With this definition the area between the correlation function and its pleateau becomes $(1-S_{\rm{CH}}^2)\tau_{e}$.

\subsection{Detecting C--H bond dynamics experimentally}

The most used parameter to detect the C--H bond dynamics experimentally in time scales comparable to simulations
are the spin-lattice relaxation rates $R_1$ from deuterium labels and $^{13}$C. 
$R_1^{C}$ measured from $^{13}$C is connected to the spectral density (Eq.~\ref{FT}) through the equation
\begin{equation}\label{R1C}
R_{1}^{C}=\frac{D_{\rm{max}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{20}\bigg[j(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{C}})+3j(\omega_{\rm{C}})+6j(\omega_{\rm{C}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg],
\end{equation}
where $\omega_{\rm{C}}$ and $\omega_{\rm{H}}$ are the Larmor angular frequencies of $^{13}$C and $^1$H respectively, 
$N_{\rm{H}}$ is the number of bound protons and $\frac{D_{\rm{max}}}{2\pi}\approx$22 kHz as in section~\ref{??}.
%is given by
%\begin{equation}
%d_{\rm{CH}}=-\frac{\mu_0\hbar\gamma_{\rm{H}}\gamma_{\rm{C}}}{4\pi\langle r_{\rm{CH}}^3\rangle},\nonumber
%\end{equation}
%where $\mu_0$ is the magnetic constant or vacuum permeability, $\hbar$ is the reduced Planck constant, 
%$\gamma_{\rm{C}}$ and $\gamma_{\rm{H}}$ are the gyromagnetic constants of $^{13}$C and $^1$H, respectively, 
%and $\langle r_{\rm{CH}}^3\rangle$ is the average cubic length of the C--H chemical bond. $d_{\rm{CH}}/2\pi$ is 
%approximately equal to -22 kHz for a methylene C--H bond \cite{Bec05:23285,Dvi05:607}.
$R_1^{D}$ measured from $^2$H is connected to the spectral density (Eq.~\ref{FT}) through the equation
\begin{equation}\label{R1C}
R_{1}^{D}=\frac{12\pi^2}{40}\bigg(\frac{e^2qQ}{h}\bigg)^2\bigg[j(\omega_{\rm{D}})+4j(2\omega_{\rm{D}})\bigg],
\end{equation}
where $\frac{e^2qQ}{h}$=170kHz as in the case of order parameters in section~\ref{??}.

Also the model free approach to measure the effective correlation time (Eq.~\ref{effCTdef}) was recently
introduced~\cite{ferreira15}. The method is based on the combination of experimental order parameter $S_{{\rm CH}}$,
spin-lattice relaxation rates $R_1$ and the transverse magnetization under a spin lock pulse $R_{1\rho}$ with measured 
appropriate nutation frequency.

%, defines the equilibration of $^{13}$C transverse magnetization under a spin lock pulse and is normally approximated as~\cite{Har86:NMRS}
%\begin{multline}\label{R1rho}
%R_{1\rho}(\omega_1)=\frac{d_{\rm{CH}}^2N_{\rm{H}}}{40}\bigg[4j(\omega_1)+j(\omega_{\rm{H}}-\omega_{\rm{C}})
%\\
%+3j(\omega_{\rm{C}})+6j(\omega_{\rm{H}})+6j(\omega_{\rm{C}}+\omega_{\rm{H}})\bigg],
%\end{multline}
%where $\omega_1$ is the nutation

%are spin
%lattice relaxation rates $R_1$ and $R_{1\rho}$

\subsection{Analyzing C--H bond dynamics from simulations}

As in the case of order parameters, the auto--correlation function for each C--H bond can be
calculated directly from simulations using the definition in Eq.~\ref{??} since the trajectories of each atom is known
as a function of time. As in the case of order parameters the positions of hydrogens can be determined 
for united atom models based on heavy atom positions and assuming tetrahedral configurations.
Usually in the correlation function calculation all the available time intervals from the 
simulation data are used and the average over those and all molecules is taken. However, since the 
amount of data decreases when the the time interval approaches the total length of the simulation,
usually the largest time interval used is the half of the total simulation length, for more details
see~\ref{gromacsMANUAL}.

To calculate the experimentally measurable spin lattice relaxation times, the spectral density (Eq.~\ref{FT})
must be first calculated. In principle, this could be done using numerical fourier transformations techniques, 
however this often leads to unneccessarily large fluctuations. Instead, commonly used apporach is to fit 
analytical functional form to the calculated auto--correlation function and then use analytical Fourier
transform of the fitted function. Most commonly the sum of ? or more exponentials is used as a fitting function but
also streched exponential has been used. Numerically the functional form of the fitting function should not matter as
long as the fit is good, however, theoretically the correct correlation function form to describe the modes of
physical motion can be debated. It is clear from correlation functions from simulations that one exponential 
is not enought to produce a good fit while ? gives a reasonable fit. This is not surprising since more
than one relaxation timescale is definitiely expected to be present in lipids in bilayer.

After the fitting the analytical form of the spectral density predicted by simulations is available.
Then its values can be calculated at the required larmor frequency values and substituted to Eqs.~\ref{R1C}
and~\ref{R1D} to get the $R_{1}^{C}$ and $R_{1}^{D}$. The value of the effective correlation time can be
calculated directly from the interated area below the correlation function, see Fig.~\ref{??} or from 
Eq. ??.




\subsection{Interplay between simulations and NMR spin lattice relaxation times: Validation and interpretation of dynamics}

The experimentally observable spin lattice relaxation parameter mentioned above ($R_1^{C}$, $R_1^{D}$ and $R_{1\rho}$)
are connected to the actual molecular dynamics through the spectral density (Eq.~\ref{FT}) which is the Fourier transformation
of the auto-correlation function~\ref{gt}. The spin lattice relaxation rates depends spectral density values only 
with certain larmor frequecies as seen from Eqs.~\ref{R1C} and~\ref{R1D}. In experiments the Larmor frequency 
depends on the external magnetic field of the used spectrometer. Thus, with a regular NMR spectrometer only
a single~\ref{R1C} and~\ref{R1D} values can be measured. These will only give information about the size
of the spectral density close to the used Larmor frequencies. However, to detect the whole rotational
correlation function one should have information with all relevant larmor frequency values. 
The single spin lattice relaxation rates only give an estimate how much of the dynamical prosesses
are present with the timescales roughly with inverse of Larmor frequency. Even the qualitative
changes in dynamics are difficult to detect by measuring single relaxation rate values since the
increase (decrease) of the value only indicates the increase (decrease) of relative significance 
of the relaxation with the detected timescales. If the general dynamics gets slower or faster depends
what happens to the significance of relaxation processes with faster and slower timescales which 
are not detected by measuring single relaxation rates.

Several experimental and theoretical apporaches has been use to address this issue.
Temperature dependence of spin relaxation rates have been measured to analyze the relative 
molecular rotational relaxation. 
Spectrometers with different magnetic field strenghts have been used to measure points with 
several Larmor frequencies.
Models are fitted to the spin relaxation data.
The effective correlation time is measured which gives a quantitative measure of the general 
rotational dynamics. Also MD simulations have been succesfull in interpretation of the 
measurements of the effect of double bonds on molecular dynamics. 

Comparison between spin lattice relaxation rates measured with NMR and calculated from MD
is also used to validate the correctness of the dynamics in the simulations.
The comparison in the early simulations revealed that there are dynamical
time scales present in simulations are realistic~\cite{??}. Later on the 
comparison between simulations and dispersion data indicated that the
simulation dynamics more or less agrees with experiments for some carbons
while there is room for improvement for others~\cite{??}. However, due to
the complicated connection between spin lattice relaxation rates and molecular dynamics
it is difficult to conclude from these comparison if the dynamics is too slow or
fast in the simulations. This issue can be clarified by measuring the effective correlation
times with recently introduced methods~\cite{ferrerira15}. The comparison between 
effective correlation times from experiments and simulations reveals that
the rotational correlation dynamics is too slow for the glycerol backbone and choline 
in Berger model. However, this is not very surprising since the Berger model is also sampling wrong configurations for
these segments. However, the experimental data and similar comparison would be useful
for models sampling more realistic strucutres, e.g. CHARMM36 which dynamics do not fully
satisfy the dispersion data.

{\tt https://github.com/NMRLipids/NmrLipidsCholXray/blob/master/scratch/FFactor/FFstructCALC.sh}\\
{\tt https://github.com/NMRLipids/NmrLipidsCholXray/tree/master/scratch/FFactor}\\
However, I have not been able to install the SIMtoEXP program ({\tt http://link.springer.com/article/10.1007\%2Fs00232-010-9254-5}) so I have not been able to check my script against the standard method.
This should be straighforward issue and should become clear once I check the details. Anyway, any kind of information from full exaplanation with citations to the hints of relevant literature are helpful here.

\noindent How accurate are the calculated form factors from simulations. \\

\todo{I think that from statistical point of view accuracy is quite high, however I am not sure about the effect of undulations etc.

\noindent What can be learned about the structure when comparing the form factors between experiments and simulations \\

\todo{I have thought that if the form factor is reproduced by the simulation, the electron density profile should be 
reasonable. However, since some people are tuning the peak highs for better agreement, I am not sure. 
There is also some connection to the thickness. There is already some discussion about this in the blog with
Peter Heftberger and Georg Pabst.
